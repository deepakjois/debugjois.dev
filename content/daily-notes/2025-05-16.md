#### Navigating by aliveness

The concept that sits right at the heart of a sane and meaningful life, I’m increasingly convinced, is something like _aliveness_. It goes by other names, too, none of which quite nail it – but it’s the one thing that, so long as you navigate by it, you’ll never go too far wrong. Sometimes it feels like a subtle electrical charge behind what’s happening, or a mildly heightened sense of clarity, or sometimes like nothing I can put into words at all. I freely concede it’s a hopelessly unscientific idea. But I’m pretty sure it’s what [Joseph Campbell](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/92u2poglkotnh6lxxveh9hz5d6d33cw/8ghqhoho3lke30tk/aHR0cHM6Ly9leGNlbGxlbmNlcmVwb3J0ZXIuY29tLzIwMTUvMDcvMjEvam9zZXBoLWNhbXBiZWxsLXRoZS1tZWFuaW5nLWFuZC10aGUtZ29hbC1vZi1saWZlLw==) meant when he said that most of us aren’t really seeking the meaning of life, but rather “an experience of being alive… so that we actually feel the rapture” – although personally I don’t think it’s always rapturous, per se – “of being alive.”
