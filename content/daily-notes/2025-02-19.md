#### Pros and Cons of uv
[A year of uv: pros, cons, and should you migrate](https://www.bitecode.dev/p/a-year-of-uv-pros-cons-and-should) #python #uv

> My conclusion is: if your situation allows it, always try `uv` first. Then fall back on something else if that doesn’t work out.

> The _Wired_ writer Leo Kim [argues that this](https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-phones-extended-mind-philosophy/) goes back to the fact that we’re all androids. In the same way that our bodies are part of who we are, so too have our phones become a functional extension of our minds. We feel naked when we go anywhere without them, and to use them is to project our consciousness into the delicate haptic experience of thumb on screen. As such, we feel much closer to our phones than we do our computers or TVs, and enter a kind of “flow state” of media consumption when interacting with them. The rest of the world blurs away as we enter a tender, individualized connection with this unique part of ourselves.

>   Most of us don’t consider this when we’re in our “flow state” of scrolling. We’re too distracted by dopamine delivery, too captivated by the psychosomatic hypnosis of holding phone in hand. We consume mechanical reproduction of mechanical reproduction, eventually losing touch of what Benjamin labels “aura”—the sublime experience of reality that reminds us to think critically.

#### Government Debt
[The Debt Scolds are Back. For Now. - by Stephanie Kelton](https://stephaniekelton.substack.com/p/the-debt-scolds-are-back-for-now) #mmt #deficit #economics 

> So what explains the renewed angst over government debt? Maybe it’s because the world’s richest man keeps [tweeting](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/elon-musk-rings-alarm-bells-says-the-u-s-is-going-bankrupt-and-urges-immediate-action-else-the-dollars-going-to-be-worth-nothing/articleshow/116719516.cms?from=mdr) that “America is going bankrupt.” Maybe it has something to do with the fact that House republicans are looking to raise the debt limit by $4 trillion while enacting sweeping tax cuts and beefing up spending on border and other priorities. Even with President Trump posting [BALANCED BUDGET!](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/feb/7/donald-trump-calls-balanced-budget-proposing-tax-c/) and DOGE flipping over seat cushions to save a billion here and there, deficits are on the republican menu. Maybe journalists are frustrated by the slow news cycle. (LOL It’s definitely not that!) Hey, maybe it’s because the U.S. Treasury Department’s own [website](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/national-debt/) uses inapplicable and reckless metaphors to

#### Romantic Love
[Three Interesting Things About Romantic Love ](https://onhumans.substack.com/p/three-interesting-things-about-romantic) #love #anthropology #romance 

> Naturally, culture matters. So does technology. The manifestations of love vary widely, from arranged cousin marriages to Durex-protected Tinder dates. But the underlying feelings seem to resonate across time and space. And why would they not? Romantic love is a natural emotion for lubricating human pair bonding — a well-respected Darwinian “strategy” amongst most birds and a minority of mammals. I write “strategy” in quotes, as some might mistake it for a cold-hearted calculation: a subconscious chess game to pass on one’s genes. This is [nonsense](https://onhumans.substack.com/p/distorting-darwinism). Love and lust have a Darwinian history but a romantic present. They are feelings which constantly turn against their original purpose, whether in the case of homosexual love — which pits love against reproduction — or in the form of disabling heartache, which devastates [not only humans but prairie voles, too.](https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nyas.15134)
