#### Pros and Cons of uv
[A year of uv: pros, cons, and should you migrate](https://www.bitecode.dev/p/a-year-of-uv-pros-cons-and-should) #python #uv

> My conclusion is: if your situation allows it, always try `uv` first. Then fall back on something else if that doesn’t work out.

#### we are all androids
[the "algorithmic gaze" affects everything you see online](https://etymology.substack.com/p/the-algorithmic-gaze-affects-everything) #culture #social-media #algorithms 

> The _Wired_ writer Leo Kim [argues that this](https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-phones-extended-mind-philosophy/) goes back to the fact that we’re all androids. In the same way that our bodies are part of who we are, so too have our phones become a functional extension of our minds. We feel naked when we go anywhere without them, and to use them is to project our consciousness into the delicate haptic experience of thumb on screen. As such, we feel much closer to our phones than we do our computers or TVs, and enter a kind of “flow state” of media consumption when interacting with them. The rest of the world blurs away as we enter a tender, individualized connection with this unique part of ourselves.

>   Most of us don’t consider this when we’re in our “flow state” of scrolling. We’re too distracted by dopamine delivery, too captivated by the psychosomatic hypnosis of holding phone in hand. We consume mechanical reproduction of mechanical reproduction, eventually losing touch of what Benjamin labels “aura”—the sublime experience of reality that reminds us to think critically.

#### Government Debt
[The Debt Scolds are Back. For Now. - by Stephanie Kelton](https://stephaniekelton.substack.com/p/the-debt-scolds-are-back-for-now) #mmt #deficit #economics 

> So what explains the renewed angst over government debt? Maybe it’s because the world’s richest man keeps [tweeting](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/elon-musk-rings-alarm-bells-says-the-u-s-is-going-bankrupt-and-urges-immediate-action-else-the-dollars-going-to-be-worth-nothing/articleshow/116719516.cms?from=mdr) that “America is going bankrupt.” Maybe it has something to do with the fact that House republicans are looking to raise the debt limit by $4 trillion while enacting sweeping tax cuts and beefing up spending on border and other priorities. Even with President Trump posting [BALANCED BUDGET!](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/feb/7/donald-trump-calls-balanced-budget-proposing-tax-c/) and DOGE flipping over seat cushions to save a billion here and there, deficits are on the republican menu. Maybe journalists are frustrated by the slow news cycle. (LOL It’s definitely not that!) Hey, maybe it’s because the U.S. Treasury Department’s own [website](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/national-debt/) uses inapplicable and reckless metaphors to 
> “explain” the national debt!

#### Romantic Love
[Three Interesting Things About Romantic Love ](https://onhumans.substack.com/p/three-interesting-things-about-romantic) #love #anthropology #romance 

> Naturally, culture matters. So does technology. The manifestations of love vary widely, from arranged cousin marriages to Durex-protected Tinder dates. But the underlying feelings seem to resonate across time and space. And why would they not? Romantic love is a natural emotion for lubricating human pair bonding — a well-respected Darwinian “strategy” amongst most birds and a minority of mammals. I write “strategy” in quotes, as some might mistake it for a cold-hearted calculation: a subconscious chess game to pass on one’s genes. This is [nonsense](https://onhumans.substack.com/p/distorting-darwinism). Love and lust have a Darwinian history but a romantic present. They are feelings which constantly turn against their original purpose, whether in the case of homosexual love — which pits love against reproduction — or in the form of disabling heartache, which devastates [not only humans but prairie voles, too.](https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nyas.15134)

> Love hurts. But that pain transcends cultures — even species.

#### Manto and Chughtai
[Daak Weekly: Manto and Chughtai’s Friendship - by Daak Vaak](https://daak.substack.com/p/daak-weekly-manto-and-chughtais-friendship) #urdu #literature #friendship 

> In a culture obsessed with the passion and drama of romantic love, we often forget to celebrate our friendships, the constant constellations of our lives, witnessing and partaking in our joys and sorrows, even, and especially, the inevitable disappointments of romance. Perhaps even more than our partners, it is our friends who provide us with the emotional and intellectual fulfillment needed to grow into our potential. However, friendships are not without their difficulties; in a relationship that has no social, familial, or legal binding, it must be chosen and nurtured, consciously and intentionally. Yet, friendships are often the first relationships to be set aside amidst life’s clawing demands, in the hopes that they will remain ever fixed when we find the time, energy, or space to come back to them.

> A friendship that embodied both these potentials and pitfalls of friendship was the one shared by the doyens of Urdu Literature, Saadat Hasan Manto and Ismat Chughtai.

#### How we lost the flow
[How We Lost the Flow - by Ted Gioia - The Honest Broker](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/how-we-lost-the-flow)

> The flow state is important because it’s our most powerful weapon against the intense tech-driven rationalization of our lives.
> 
> The dominance of STEM-thinking has left so many of us hollow inside. In a world of intense rationality and digitization, people’s inner lives are gradually destroyed. They are hungry for something deeper, holistic, and more vital than data manipulation can deliver.
> 
> Just look at all the metrics on self-harm, suicide, addiction, depression, psychic disorders of every sort. People will tell you that you can’t measure a crisis in the inner life, but that’s not true—there are plenty of numbers and charts that spell it out.
> 
> The deepest thinkers of the last century have grasped this—and laid the foundation for flow psychology. I need to give credit to philosopher Henri Bergson (1859-1942), seldom read nowadays—but it's no coincidence that his work influenced Proust (the deepest psychological novelist of them all), or that Bergson wrote one of the great philosophical studies of comedy.
> 
> These insights are developed further in Husserl, Merleau-Ponty, Heidegger, and others—all the way up to the leading thinkers of our own time, [such as Charles Taylor and Iain McGilchrist](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/my-alternative-tech-canon-26-mind).
> 
> These rank among the wisest individuals of modern times. But their wisdom is shut out in the cold by a data-driven, profit-driven, device-driven culture.
> 
> Even worse, we are now robbed of our flow state—which is now getting hijacked for corporate enrichment.


> Scroll-and-swipe apps are now the dictators of the flow state for a billion or so people.
> 
> Their role model is narcotics, by the way. That, too, was once a destructive blight only criminals took advantage of. But it has now gone legit with support from the wealthy and powerful.
> 
> Scroll-and-swipe only got invented a few years ago, but it is already far bigger than the drug business. By the way, it is also run by a cartel—I call it [the dopamine cartel](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/the-state-of-the-culture-2024).
> 
> Substacker [Ken Klippenstein](https://www.kenklippenstein.com/) has an even better name. He calls it the _Appistocracy_. I like that term, and will start using it myself. It aptly describes the forces arrayed against us.
> 
> In our age of Appistocracy, everything online is getting turned into a kind of casino. Web interfaces deliberately emulate slot machines. The pacing, the colors, the hypnotic repetitions, and the like.
