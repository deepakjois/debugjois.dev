[Deconstructing the matcha obsession - Coffee Intelligence](https://intelligence.coffee/2025/09/deconstructing-the-matcha-obsession/)

With the caveat that this is a publication that covers the coffee industry, and hence there might be a bias - this is an excellect guide to the current matcha obsession.

> But growth is not infinite. True ceremonial-grade matcha requires shade-grown leaves, painstakingly ground between granite stones. [Supplies are thin](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgq7w1n00xeo) and cannot be scaled overnight. As demand surges in Europe and North America, [lower-grade powders – sometimes blended with green tea dust or other fillers –](https://aiya-europe.com/en/fight-fake-matcha/) are sold as “authentic” matcha.


> **Green by association**
> 
> Why does matcha feel so different from coffee, a drink it increasingly competes with in cafés? Part of the answer lies in colour. 
> 
> Consumers often equate green with health and sustainability. [Colour psychology studies](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/376712079_Color_green_and_sustainable_consumption_behavior_A_self-expansion_perspective) reveal that many consumers equate green with nature. A matcha latte, even when drowned in syrup and sweet frothy milk, still somehow manages to convey a halo of wellness.
> 
> The health claims themselves are more ambiguous. Matcha contains caffeine – roughly [60-70 milligrams per serving](https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/ucla-health-dietitian-discusses-matcha-amid-global-shortage), less than coffee but more than many teas – alongside L-theanine, an amino acid thought to mitigate caffeine’s jitters. Some studies suggest it may aid focus, though evidence is limited. The antioxidant narrative is stronger: matcha is rich in catechins, [particularly EGCG](https://time.com/5188377/matcha-tea-benefits/]), which in laboratory conditions have shown anti-inflammatory, even cancer-fighting, effects on the body. While studies have shown associations between matcha and better health, [causation is not yet proven](https://time.com/5188377/matcha-tea-benefits/) and factors like amount per serving matter – matcha remains even less studied than brewed green tea.

> “I think that demand begins at either the healthy side or the visually exciting and decadent side of the spectrum,” says Will. “Matcha-flavoured sweets and milkshakes attract a lot of consumers, especially when they’re presented in cheerful and colorful ways.”
> 
> “The science is pretty well-established when it comes to the health benefits of things like antioxidants and polyphenols, and L-Theanine – all naturally occurring in tea. Matcha is packed full of these things. But by the time it’s mixed with 10oz of milk and 30g of sugar, the health benefits are diminished. As long as the perception – and much of the scientific research – remains murky, folks will conveniently ignore the contradictions when treating themselves.”
> 
> The irony is that coffee – unsweetened, no additives, and in moderation – long derided as an anxious vice, has better scientific backing as a healthy habit. [Dozens of large studies](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/15/2558#:~:text=A%202019%20meta%2Danalysis%20of,and%20caffeine%20content%20of%20coffee.) link moderate coffee consumption with lower risks of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. 
> 
> Still, matcha’s presentation as a “cleaner” alternative resonates, especially among consumers who dislike coffee’s bitterness or fear its caffeine spikes. 
> 
> Matcha’s cultural cachet has also been bound up with social performance. Online, the drink is often used as a prop in videos that parody hyper-optimised masculinity: the matcha-latte-drinking, feminist-literature reading, vinyl touting [“performative male.”](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/04/matcha-latte-performative-male) 
> 
> In that sense, matcha has become less a taste than a lifestyle symbol. And beyond [social currency](https://intelligence.coffee/2025/07/coffee-is-evolving-as-social-currency/), like protein powders and collagen shots, it reflects [a wider consumer shift where drinks are expected to stack functions](https://intelligence.coffee/2025/07/why-we-keep-adding-things-to-coffee/) like to energise, beautify, or detoxify rather than merely be a beverage.

> The matcha craze may follow a similar trajectory: stabilising as a premium category, with a smaller base of genuine regulars once the hype ebbs. Already, hojicha – roasted green tea with a toasty flavour profile – is being hailed by many as [“the next matcha.”](https://www.ft.com/content/45d8d878-605f-4b2d-bfeb-70f8c9fc60c1) The cycle of discovery and commodification continues to spin.

> When consumers demand infinite growth from finite goods, the result is scarcity, price spikes and often quality erosion. The matcha craze is less about the drink itself, and more about the marketing playbook it represents: colour as health, scarcity as status, and ritual as lifestyle.
