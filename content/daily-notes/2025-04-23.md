[Crypto Might Get Some Banks - Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/newsletters/2025-04-21/crypto-might-get-some-banks?cmpid=BBD042125_MONEYSTUFF&sref=6rqLu4ZS)

> But narrow banking pops up elsewhere. One important modern form is _stablecoins_. A stablecoin is a crypto form of banking: You deposit dollars with a stablecoin issuer, it gives you back tokens entitling you to get your dollars back, and meanwhile it does whatever it wants with the dollars. In the unregulated early days of crypto, “whatever it wants” could be [quite spicy indeed](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-04-26/things-got-weird-for-stablecoin-tether), but these days [stablecoins are a big business](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/newsletters/2025-04-02/stablecoins-are-growing-up?srnd=undefined) and there is something of a norm of parking the deposits in very safe short-term dollar-denominated assets, ideally Treasury bills or reverse repos or a BlackRock money market fund. If you launched a new stablecoin today and said “we will take your dollars and use them to make loans to emerging crypto entrepreneurs,” you’d have a hard time competing with the big incumbent stablecoins that say “we will take your dollars and use them to buy Treasury bills.” (Especially if, like most stablecoins, you didn’t pay interest.)
