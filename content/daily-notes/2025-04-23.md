#### Banking and Crypto
[Crypto Might Get Some Banks - Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/newsletters/2025-04-21/crypto-might-get-some-banks?cmpid=BBD042125_MONEYSTUFF&sref=6rqLu4ZS) #crypto #stablecoin 

> But narrow banking pops up elsewhere. One important modern form is _stablecoins_. A stablecoin is a crypto form of banking: You deposit dollars with a stablecoin issuer, it gives you back tokens entitling you to get your dollars back, and meanwhile it does whatever it wants with the dollars. In the unregulated early days of crypto, “whatever it wants” could be [quite spicy indeed](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-04-26/things-got-weird-for-stablecoin-tether), but these days [stablecoins are a big business](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/newsletters/2025-04-02/stablecoins-are-growing-up?srnd=undefined) and there is something of a norm of parking the deposits in very safe short-term dollar-denominated assets, ideally Treasury bills or reverse repos or a BlackRock money market fund. If you launched a new stablecoin today and said “we will take your dollars and use them to make loans to emerging crypto entrepreneurs,” you’d have a hard time competing with the big incumbent stablecoins that say “we will take your dollars and use them to buy Treasury bills.” (Especially if, like most stablecoins, you didn’t pay interest.)


#### The Future is Augmentation
[Why LLM-Powered Programming is More Mech Suit Than Artificial Human](https://matthewsinclair.com/blog/0178-why-llm-powered-programming-is-more-mech-suit-than-artificial-human) #llm #coding #software #programming 

> There is a view in many circles that LLMs will replace programmers. I am hesitant to say that this will _never_ happen, becuase a lot of things with LLMs have surprised me recently, and I expect more surprises to come. For now, however, I don’t see LLMs _effectively_ replacing programmers; but they are transforming how we work. Like Ripley in her Power Loader, we’re learning to operate powerful new tools that extend our capabilities far beyond what we could achieve alone.
> 
> This transformation will change what we value in developers. Raw coding ability becomes less important; architectural thinking, pattern recognition, and technical judgment become more crucial. The ability to effectively direct and collaborate with AI tools emerges as a vital skill in itself.
> 
> The developers who thrive in this new environment won’t be those who fear or resist AI tools, but those who master them—who understand both their extraordinary potential and their very real limitations. They’ll recognise that the goal isn’t to remove humans from the equation but to enhance what humans can accomplish.
> 
> In my view, that’s something to embrace, not fear. The mech suit awaits, and with it comes the potential to build software at scales and speeds previously unimaginable—but only for those skilled enough to operate the machines in ways that don’t harm themselves or those around them.
