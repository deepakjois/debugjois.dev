#### Rigidity in Islamic Societies
[State Power & Punishment - by Alice Evans](https://www.ggd.world/p/power-and-punishment) #islam #religion #power 

> Nobel laureates Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson have a brilliant new paper, published in the _Journal of Economic Literature_, proposing a [dynamic interaction between culture and institutions](https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2023-04/Culture%2C%20Institutions%20and%20Social%20Equilibria%20-%20A%20Framework.pdf). They suggest that a society’s values legitimise particular economic and political institutions, which then shape emergent configurations of culture. In their theory, each cultural set has a set of ‘[attributes](https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2023-04/Culture%2C%20Institutions%20and%20Social%20Equilibria%20-%20A%20Framework.pdf)’ (which can be abstract or specific). These sets can be ‘[free-standing](https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2023-04/Culture%2C%20Institutions%20and%20Social%20Equilibria%20-%20A%20Framework.pdf)’ or ‘[entangled’](https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2023-04/Culture%2C%20Institutions%20and%20Social%20Equilibria%20-%20A%20Framework.pdf)

> Contrasting cultural evolution across world regions, they suggest that Islam has some ‘highly specified’ attributes, which are also ‘entangled’. Sharia reigns supreme, since it is the word of God, revealed by Mohammad. Given this fundamental set of attributes, reinterpretation or critique becomes illegitimate. Instead, Muslims usually gravitate to scriptural literalism, and the religion thus becomes relatively ‘[hard-wired](https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2023-04/Culture%2C%20Institutions%20and%20Social%20Equilibria%20-%20A%20Framework.pdf)’, [less open to contestation or institutional reform](https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2023-04/Culture%2C%20Institutions%20and%20Social%20Equilibria%20-%20A%20Framework.pdf). Rulers then cement their authority by invoking and entrenching Islamic values.

Alice Evans critically engages with Acemoglu and Robinson’s theory on the dynamic interaction between culture and institutions, focusing on Islamic societies. She argues that state power, prestige, and punishment are key engines sustaining cultural norms, especially through religiously sanctioned enforcement mechanisms like the office of hisba.

**Key Takeaways**

• Islamic cultural rigidity is not "hard-wired" but enforced through state power and punishment.
• The office of hisba historically policed morality, legitimizing rulers and controlling social behavior.
• Power, prestige, and punishment together shape cultural evolution and institutional legitimacy.

#### “Positive” Masculinity

> Masculinity is always in crisis, and the crisis is always new. In 1100, chronicler Oderic Vitalis railed against pointy shoes, for initiating young men into lives of effeminacy and sexual deviance. In the 1930s, George Orwell blamed the suburbs and middle-class morality. Today, it’s violent misogynist Andrew Tate and his legion of off-brand masculinity influencers.

TIL about the term "toxic masculinity"

> ‘Toxic masculinity’ was not a concept born of feminism. The phrase was coined, at least in print, by Shepherd Bliss, a member of the mythopoetic men’s movement – a mostly 1980s and 90s phenomenon that tried to explain why men felt like shit.

> Can we really solve patriarchal violence with good patriarchs, who deserve their authority and always get things right? Envisioning a way out of oppressive masculinity is obviously better than defending it, but the positive masculinity movement hasn’t done much envisioning. ‘Healthy masculinity’ means both everything and nothing at the same time. Plus, some of its advocates are startlingly conservative: a recent BetterHelp ad features a man with a soothing voice being asked what ‘healthy masculinity looks like in 2025’, and telling the listener “maybe the tropes of provide and protect still hold,” clarifying that “maybe it’s less about muscles right now and maybe it’s about protecting your partner’s spirit or protecting their emotional safety.” Some are pushing back against traditional gender roles in more meaningful ways, but the language of ‘healthy masculinity’ leaves their endgame a great big mystery box. Do they want the borders of masculinity to be less policed, or do they just want to slightly expand the territory of what is acceptable for men? And where, if at all, do women fit into this?
