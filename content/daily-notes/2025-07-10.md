#### Rigidity in Islamic Societies
[State Power & Punishment - by Alice Evans](https://www.ggd.world/p/power-and-punishment) #islam #religion #power 

> Nobel laureates Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson have a brilliant new paper, published in the _Journal of Economic Literature_, proposing a [dynamic interaction between culture and institutions](https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2023-04/Culture%2C%20Institutions%20and%20Social%20Equilibria%20-%20A%20Framework.pdf). They suggest that a society’s values legitimise particular economic and political institutions, which then shape emergent configurations of culture. In their theory, each cultural set has a set of ‘[attributes](https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2023-04/Culture%2C%20Institutions%20and%20Social%20Equilibria%20-%20A%20Framework.pdf)’ (which can be abstract or specific). These sets can be ‘[free-standing](https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2023-04/Culture%2C%20Institutions%20and%20Social%20Equilibria%20-%20A%20Framework.pdf)’ or ‘[entangled’](https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2023-04/Culture%2C%20Institutions%20and%20Social%20Equilibria%20-%20A%20Framework.pdf)

> Contrasting cultural evolution across world regions, they suggest that Islam has some ‘highly specified’ attributes, which are also ‘entangled’. Sharia reigns supreme, since it is the word of God, revealed by Mohammad. Given this fundamental set of attributes, reinterpretation or critique becomes illegitimate. Instead, Muslims usually gravitate to scriptural literalism, and the religion thus becomes relatively ‘[hard-wired](https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2023-04/Culture%2C%20Institutions%20and%20Social%20Equilibria%20-%20A%20Framework.pdf)’, [less open to contestation or institutional reform](https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2023-04/Culture%2C%20Institutions%20and%20Social%20Equilibria%20-%20A%20Framework.pdf). Rulers then cement their authority by invoking and entrenching Islamic values.

Alice Evans critically engages with Acemoglu and Robinson’s theory on the dynamic interaction between culture and institutions, focusing on Islamic societies. She argues that state power, prestige, and punishment are key engines sustaining cultural norms, especially through religiously sanctioned enforcement mechanisms like the office of hisba.

**Key Takeaways**

• Islamic cultural rigidity is not "hard-wired" but enforced through state power and punishment.
• The office of hisba historically policed morality, legitimizing rulers and controlling social behavior.
• Power, prestige, and punishment together shape cultural evolution and institutional legitimacy.

#### “Positive” Masculinity
[The problem with ‘positive masculinity’ \| Dazed](https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/68183/1/in-attack-of-positive-masculinity-misogyny-andrew-tate-adolescence) #masculinity #gender #patriarchy 

> Masculinity is always in crisis, and the crisis is always new. In 1100, chronicler Oderic Vitalis railed against pointy shoes, for initiating young men into lives of effeminacy and sexual deviance. In the 1930s, George Orwell blamed the suburbs and middle-class morality. Today, it’s violent misogynist Andrew Tate and his legion of off-brand masculinity influencers.

TIL about the term "toxic masculinity"

> ‘Toxic masculinity’ was not a concept born of feminism. The phrase was coined, at least in print, by Shepherd Bliss, a member of the mythopoetic men’s movement – a mostly 1980s and 90s phenomenon that tried to explain why men felt like shit.

> Can we really solve patriarchal violence with good patriarchs, who deserve their authority and always get things right? Envisioning a way out of oppressive masculinity is obviously better than defending it, but the positive masculinity movement hasn’t done much envisioning. ‘Healthy masculinity’ means both everything and nothing at the same time. Plus, some of its advocates are startlingly conservative: a recent BetterHelp ad features a man with a soothing voice being asked what ‘healthy masculinity looks like in 2025’, and telling the listener “maybe the tropes of provide and protect still hold,” clarifying that “maybe it’s less about muscles right now and maybe it’s about protecting your partner’s spirit or protecting their emotional safety.” Some are pushing back against traditional gender roles in more meaningful ways, but the language of ‘healthy masculinity’ leaves their endgame a great big mystery box. Do they want the borders of masculinity to be less policed, or do they just want to slightly expand the territory of what is acceptable for men? And where, if at all, do women fit into this?


#### Notes from an experienced software dev

Advice about software engineering that is worth repeating in full

> Senior SWE, 12 YoE. The discourse around software development is incredibly chaotic and anxiety-inducing. I deal with the same emotions as everyone, but I manage to keep going despite having worked in a very poorly run company for a long time on a severely neglected product amidst product cancellation, brand cancellation, mass layoffs (one of which affected me), mismanagement, offshoring, you name it. I have managed to stay actively learning new tech, engaged on challenging problems, and having positive interactions with my coworkers consistently, even when one or more parties are being difficult to work with (which we all can be guilty of, myself included).

> Here, I am to about share what keeps me grounded within all the noise.
> 
> This post itself is not a statement of fact, but a belief. But it keeps me going through all the noise and bullshit.
> 
> Also, a caveat: The claims I am making aren't the only claims to be made, and there are other important things to know. For example: It is true that all high value work is deep work, but it's not true that all deep work is high value work. A rectangle isn't necessarily a square.
> 
> All high value work is deep work, and all motivation is based on belief.
> 
> High value work is differentiated work. It's your moat. Not everyone has the grit, the attitude, the determination, and the ability to focus on challenging problems involving abstract concepts, especially when there is no immediate gratification, and when there is significant adversity in the environment. This is true of the population at large. But even within engineering/development, there are levels to this. Most people refuse to read. Most people refuse to do research. Most people panic when they see big log messages or stack traces. Most people give up when their code won't compile after googling for 20 minutes, if they even try googling at all. If you're the opposite of that kind of person, you will always be valuable in development.
> 
> All motivation is based on belief. Use this fact to be a leader, and use this fact to motivate yourself. All hard workers work hard because they believe they will benefit from it.
> 
> For some people, it is enough benefit to simply get in a flow state and enjoy solving a problem. But there is something deeper. Ask yourself what it is for you. Some examples:
> 
> - ego boost (I am so smart wow)
>     
> - prestige/praise (he/she is so smart wow)
>     
> - distraction/addictive pattern (my marriage/family/health/social life sucks so bad, I need to forget for a while)
>     
> - raw gratitude (or is it cope energy?) (I am grateful I get this fat paycheck to sit inside in comfortable temperatures and ergonomics, safely on a computer with no risk of injury or death, no one berating me constantly, no dealing with unreasonable patrons/patients/customers/schoolkids etc, just to solve challenging problems and be in a flow state, and if I could earn this money in a band or as a gamer I would but I can't so I'm just grateful for this opportunity so I can focus on myself and my family and my hobbies outside of work and build a nest egg for my family)
>     
> - social (I love the people I work with, I genuinely have fun at the office with these cool people and I would still hang out with these people even if I weren't being paid)
>     
> 
> Find out what motivates you, understand it, contextualize it, and ACCEPT it. Once you do that, you can have the space to figure out the same for others and help them along. I recommend taking the gratitude route. Gratitude can apply pretty broadly. It is actually a major life lesson in happiness.
> 
> Also, yes, corporate America is toxic. But you choose to work there. Every day you choose to work there, you should 100% double down on acceptance, or 100% double down on trying to find another job. Anything in between is total misery. Don't live life in resistance to what is. Accept what you can't control and work hard on what you can control. Either go to a startup and accept the risks, become politically active and solve the problem that way, or accept that you want the money badly enough and that the greedy, lying toxic charlatans running corporate America are the ones most able to give you the fat paycheck you signed up for.

> Find what it is that motivates you in this field, and use that motivation to power some deep work so that you have some staying power in this field. It all starts in your own mind.
