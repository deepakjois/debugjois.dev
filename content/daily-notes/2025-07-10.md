#### Rigidity in Islamic Societies
[State Power & Punishment - by Alice Evans](https://www.ggd.world/p/power-and-punishment) #islam #religion #power 

> Nobel laureates Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson have a brilliant new paper, published in the _Journal of Economic Literature_, proposing a [dynamic interaction between culture and institutions](https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2023-04/Culture%2C%20Institutions%20and%20Social%20Equilibria%20-%20A%20Framework.pdf). They suggest that a society’s values legitimise particular economic and political institutions, which then shape emergent configurations of culture. In their theory, each cultural set has a set of ‘[attributes](https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2023-04/Culture%2C%20Institutions%20and%20Social%20Equilibria%20-%20A%20Framework.pdf)’ (which can be abstract or specific). These sets can be ‘[free-standing](https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2023-04/Culture%2C%20Institutions%20and%20Social%20Equilibria%20-%20A%20Framework.pdf)’ or ‘[entangled’](https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2023-04/Culture%2C%20Institutions%20and%20Social%20Equilibria%20-%20A%20Framework.pdf)

> Contrasting cultural evolution across world regions, they suggest that Islam has some ‘highly specified’ attributes, which are also ‘entangled’. Sharia reigns supreme, since it is the word of God, revealed by Mohammad. Given this fundamental set of attributes, reinterpretation or critique becomes illegitimate. Instead, Muslims usually gravitate to scriptural literalism, and the religion thus becomes relatively ‘[hard-wired](https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2023-04/Culture%2C%20Institutions%20and%20Social%20Equilibria%20-%20A%20Framework.pdf)’, [less open to contestation or institutional reform](https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2023-04/Culture%2C%20Institutions%20and%20Social%20Equilibria%20-%20A%20Framework.pdf). Rulers then cement their authority by invoking and entrenching Islamic values.

Alice Evans critically engages with Acemoglu and Robinson’s theory on the dynamic interaction between culture and institutions, focusing on Islamic societies. She argues that state power, prestige, and punishment are key engines sustaining cultural norms, especially through religiously sanctioned enforcement mechanisms like the office of hisba.

**Key Takeaways**

• Islamic cultural rigidity is not "hard-wired" but enforced through state power and punishment.
• The office of hisba historically policed morality, legitimizing rulers and controlling social behavior.
• Power, prestige, and punishment together shape cultural evolution and institutional legitimacy.
