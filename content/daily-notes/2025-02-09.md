#### The Psychology of Severance

> This disconnection is particularly evident in Mark S., the protagonist, whose "outie" has chosen to undergo the severance procedure to escape the [grief](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/grief "Psychology Today looks at grief") of losing his wife. Yet his "innie" is trapped in a cycle of meaningless labor, unable to understand why he exists only within Lumon’s walls. His "innie" never sleeps, never rests, and the minute he leaves work, his next conscious experience is that of arriving at the office again for a new 8-hour work cycle. This mirrors what we see in some trauma survivors, who may [unconsciously or consciously repress or dissociate from painful memories](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2080858/) as a [defense mechanism](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/defense-mechanisms "Psychology Today looks at defense mechanism"). The severance procedure is, in effect, an extreme version of psychological [compartmentalization](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/compartmentalization "Psychology Today looks at compartmentalization")—a way to avoid emotional pain by physically splitting off access to distressing memories.
