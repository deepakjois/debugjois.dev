This podcast with Wendy Liu was a very inspiring listen.

Wendy wrote a biography in which she covers her disillusionment with the Silicon Valley dream which led her from being a failed startup founder to studying inequality at LSE.

Her book:  [Abolish Silicon Valley: How to Liberate Technology from Capitalism](https://a.co/d/3CUoHvp)
