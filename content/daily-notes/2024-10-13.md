I especially liked the bit in the podcast where the host mentions how the Nobel season is kinda busy for science journalists because they have to be on their toes tracking the work of the prize winners and also making sure they are writing and presenting their work in an accessible manner.

I have enjoyed many episodes. This one is a great history overview of Guillermo del Toro's movies. I have watched and enjoyed many films from him, but never stopped to think about his impact and legacy

- Also started [Amazon.com: Convenience Store Woman: A Novel eBook : Murata, Sayaka, Tapley Takemori, Ginny: Kindle Store](https://www.amazon.com/Convenience-Store-Woman-Sayaka-Murata-ebook/dp/B075VC651Y) - This book was recommended to me by somebody at Blue Tokai HSR. I saw them reading Mieko Kawakami's _Breasts and Eggs_, a book I had started reading but did not finish. I am huge fan of Mieko Kawakami's other book _All the Lovers in the Night_, so seeing that book piqued me enough to talk to that person. The conversation went to many different places
