#### Why software work estimations are hard

> I’m also going to concede that **sometimes you can accurately estimate software work**, when that work is very well-understood and very small in scope. For instance, if I know it takes half an hour to deploy a service[1](https://www.seangoedecke.com/how-i-estimate-work/#fn-1), and I’m being asked to update the text in a link, I can accurately estimate the work at something like 45 minutes: five minutes to push the change up, ten minutes to wait for CI, thirty minutes to deploy.

Most programming in large systems is _research_: identifying prior art, mapping out enough of the system to understand the effects of changes, and so on. Even for fairly small changes, we simply do not know what’s involved in making the change until we go and look.

> The pro-estimation dogma says that these questions ought to be answered during the planning process, so that each individual piece of work being discussed is scoped small enough to be accurately estimated. I’m not impressed by this answer. It seems to me to be a throwback to the bad old days of [software architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architect), where one architect would map everything out in advance, so that individual programmers simply had to mechanically follow instructions. Nobody does that now, because it doesn’t work: programmers must be empowered to make architectural decisions, because they’re the ones who are actually in contact with the code[2](https://www.seangoedecke.com/how-i-estimate-work/#fn-2). Even if it did work, that would simply shift the impossible-to-estimate part of the process backwards, into the planning meeting (where of course you can’t write or run code, which makes it near-impossible to accurately answer the kind of questions involved).
