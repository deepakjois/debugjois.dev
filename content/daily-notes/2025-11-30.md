[Career Minimalism: The Gen-Z Trend Rewriting Work-Life Balance \| The Everygirl](https://theeverygirl.com/gen-z-career-minimalism-trend/)

> “Career minimalism” is a growing workplace phenomenon that many Gen Z professionals are embracing in favor of sustainability, characterized by stable day jobs that offer healthy boundaries and a sense of stability, rather than a nonstop hustle.
> 
> **Those who practice “career minimalism” don’t center their identities around their work, meaning they pursue passions, [hobbies](https://theeverygirl.com/hobby-menu-tiktok-trend/), and other interests outside of their day job for a more well-rounded identity.** Essentially, their careers are a minor part of their lives and who they are, so they have more time and space to pursue other things that matter to them.

> Some Gen Zers are leaning into another recent trend, “[conscious unbossing](https://theeverygirl.com/conscious-unbossing-work-trend/)”—the intentional decision to reject traditional leadership roles. While jobs in middle management may have previously been necessary stepping stones for forward career trajectories, Gen Z workers have had a [front-row seat](https://www.kornferry.com/insights/this-week-in-leadership/why-gen-z-is-saying-no-to-management) in witnessing their parents and their own direct managers burn out. Additionally, they’re considering whether they have the desire and [skills to step into a management role](https://theeverygirl.com/discernment-leadership-skill/), while weighing these factors against the level of anticipated stress.
> 
> These observations and shifts are leading to a collective feeling that what lies beyond working yourself to the bone (more money, more pressure) isn’t all that it’s cracked up to be. For many, the rewards aren’t worth the chase, and practicing “career minimalism” helps them set these boundaries.
