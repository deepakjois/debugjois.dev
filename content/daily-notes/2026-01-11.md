Very relatable atm.

#### Tsundoku
I knew this term, but I liked how the tweet came together with the pics and everything.

> In Japanese, "tsundoku" means collecting books and letting them pile up, not for neglect, but for the joy of knowing they're there, full of untold stories.

#### RIP Sweetgreens
[The Rise and Fall of the Ultimate Millennial Power Lunch](https://archive.ph/SXbqh#selection-689.0-708.0) #salad #millenial 

It seems like just yesterday when I was ordering Sweetgreens on the app several times a week and walking the few blocks in from my apartment (or WeWork) in NYC (where I was living at that tmie) to pick it up from the store. How things have changed!

> In the first two months of last year, Sweetgreen’s stock price had declined more than 30 percent. The company had already made significant changes, dropping seed oils, adding “protein plates,” and hiring a bunch of robots in an apparent effort to cater to the early 2020s’ three defining dining trends: the [MAHA movement](https://archive.ph/o/SXbqh/https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/08/maha-rfk-jr-progress-report/683965/), the [protein fixation](https://archive.ph/o/SXbqh/https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/06/protein-supplements-too-far/683239/), and the push to cut costs by eliminating human labor. But not even air-fried potatoes could stop Sweetgreen’s free fall. In August, with operational losses reaching $26.4 million, the chain fired workers, and [also the fries](https://archive.ph/o/SXbqh/https://www.restaurantdive.com/news/sweetgreen-corporate-layoffs-ends-ripple-fries/757213/). As the year ended, Nathaniel Ru, who co-founded the company in 2007, stepped down from his role. Today, a share of Sweetgreen stock costs less than $8. In late 2024, it was more than $43.

> Sweetgreen’s early success was not a fluke. As a restaurant, it truly did do something incredible. The company put high-quality organic produce in interesting combinations, incorporating fresh herbs and global ingredients, and going heavy on crunch and citrus. It sourced from small farms that it listed proudly on chalkboards inside each store, appealing squarely to a cohort who knew they really should be shopping at the farmers’ market, even if they usually got their groceries from Instacart, guiltily. And Sweetgreen was an early adopter of online ordering, allowing its customers to waste less time waiting in line. When a Sweetgreen opened in my city, in 2016, [replacing](https://archive.ph/o/SXbqh/https://sf.eater.com/2016/4/19/11461236/sweetgreen-open-berkeley) a restaurant that had been serving hamburgers for 65 years, I was excited about it the same way I was excited when fiber internet came to my neighborhood: _Finally, a better way to live_.

The next paragraph makes me feel very seen (not in a good way!)

> Sweetgreen was what you ate while listening to, if not the _Hamilton_ soundtrack, then a self-improvement podcast at 1.5 speed, ripping through emails or shopping online before dutifully composting your beautifully designed, biodegradable bowl. It was the perfect fuel for the grinning strivers of the long 2010s, when a better world was possible, and in fact something you could buy. When a dear friend of mine got married, what she wanted to eat more than anything else while being poked and prettied in the hotel suite was Sweetgreen. It was the most reliable, most delicious, least risky meal either of us could think to pick up at an exceptionally frenetic moment. But it also made sense, spiritually, on a day that often requires [total command](https://archive.ph/o/SXbqh/https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/aug/02/athleisure-barre-kale-tyranny-ideal-woman-labour) over both one’s appearance and a large number of spreadsheets—a day that is a public declaration of hope for the future, and, in some ways, the first day of your adult life.


> I think Sweetgreen didn’t change so much as the world around it did. A $15 salad was never really an investment in one’s health, but it _certainly_ doesn’t feel like that in this economy—and besides, that moment has passed. The optimism of the previous era has given way to something more nihilistic. The people who were once going to guac this week are now quiet quitting and scarfing tallow. The “power” in Millennial power lunch has, largely, been replaced by impotence and apathy. WeWork went bankrupt; _Hamilton_ became cringe; trying so hard to do the right things all the time started to feel pointless and naive. When I told a friend and fellow former Sweetgreen enthusiast about this story, he said, “What’s the point of eating a salad when we’re all going to die?” He was joking, kind of.

#### Morning Coffee Rave Parties ftw

> On a Saturday morning in October, Park Jihyun woke up at 5:30 a.m. to go raving in Seoul.

> And much about her prep routine was counterintuitive.

> Instead of shimmying into a miniskirt, the 29-year-old pulled on a pair of running tights. Instead of slipping her feet into a set of precarious heels, she slipped into running shoes. And in lieu of hailing a cab to the party, she ran from her apartment to the venue in Yongsan-gu, arriving after an hour-long, 5-mile jog, ready to hit the dance floor.

> “It’s just random people who meet for the first time. But as we start dancing together, it becomes crazier as time flies,” Park says.
> 
> Since launching in May, the Seoul Morning Coffee Club’s Coffee Rave has become a viral success, drawing hundreds of like-minded Seoulites from the comfort of their beds to dance at daybreak.
> 
> Attendees, who have paid 20,000 won (about $14) for their ticket, start trickling in at 7 a.m., and line up for their drink of choice, often an iced Americano or a matcha. By 8 a.m., the DJ is pumping out hypnotic bass beats for an [enthusiastic crowd of revelers](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/na6gQu6-T0Q) who are jumping in unison in the clear, bright light of day, with nothing but caffeine to fuel their booze-free rave.
