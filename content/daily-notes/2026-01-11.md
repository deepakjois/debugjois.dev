Very relatable atm.

#### Tsundoku
I knew this term, but I liked how the tweet came together with the pics and everything.

> In Japanese, "tsundoku" means collecting books and letting them pile up, not for neglect, but for the joy of knowing they're there, full of untold stories.

#### RIP Sweetgreens

It seems like just yesterday when I was ordering Sweetgreens on the app several times a week and walking the few blocks in from my apartment (or WeWork) in NYC (where I was living at that tmie) to pick it up from the store. How things have changed!

> In the first two months of last year, Sweetgreen’s stock price had declined more than 30 percent. The company had already made significant changes, dropping seed oils, adding “protein plates,” and hiring a bunch of robots in an apparent effort to cater to the early 2020s’ three defining dining trends: the [MAHA movement](https://archive.ph/o/SXbqh/https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/08/maha-rfk-jr-progress-report/683965/), the [protein fixation](https://archive.ph/o/SXbqh/https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/06/protein-supplements-too-far/683239/), and the push to cut costs by eliminating human labor. But not even air-fried potatoes could stop Sweetgreen’s free fall. In August, with operational losses reaching $26.4 million, the chain fired workers, and [also the fries](https://archive.ph/o/SXbqh/https://www.restaurantdive.com/news/sweetgreen-corporate-layoffs-ends-ripple-fries/757213/). As the year ended, Nathaniel Ru, who co-founded the company in 2007, stepped down from his role. Today, a share of Sweetgreen stock costs less than $8. In late 2024, it was more than $43.
