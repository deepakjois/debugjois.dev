TIL, coffee is grown in California

> When you think of coffee production in America, the first place that comes to mind is undoubtedly Hawaii, Kona in particular. But it is not the only state commercially growing coffee. California is home to a few extremely small coffee farms, though few have risen above novelty; even the most avid specialty coffee drinkers are unlikely to have ever tasted any. But that may be changing soon thanks for [Frinj Coffee](https://frinjcoffee.com/). The Ventura-based farm will be the first continental American producer to take part in an international coffee auction.
