#### Matt Levine on Stablecoins
[Stablecoins Are Growing Up - Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/newsletters/2025-04-02/stablecoins-are-growing-up) #stablecoin #money #finance #crypto 

> I have always thought of stablecoins as basically unregulated non-interest-paying crypto banks. The idea of a stablecoin is that there is a company, the stablecoin issuer, and you send the company dollars, and it gives you back tokens (“stablecoins”). Each token is supposed to be worth a dollar, and if you hand the issuer back a token it will hand you back a dollar.[1](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/newsletters/2025-04-02/stablecoins-are-growing-up?cmpid=BBD040225_MONEYSTUFF&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_term=250402&utm_campaign=moneystuff&sref=6rqLu4ZS#footer-ref-footnote-1) But mostly you hold onto the stablecoins and the issuer holds onto your dollars. You both arguably benefit from this:
> 
> - You can use the tokens like dollars on in crypto applications, where actual dollars are hard to use: The stablecoins live natively on various crypto blockchains, can be sent over the blockchain, can be used in smart contracts, etc., in ways that don’t really work with dollars held in bank accounts.
> - The issuer has the dollars, which it can invest in super-safe short-dated US Treasury bills, _or anything else_, to make money. It doesn’t pay you any interest; any profit it makes from its investing is the issuer’s to keep.
> 
> But yesterday Circle Internet Group Inc., the big US-based issuer of the USDC stablecoin, [filed publicly for an initial public offering](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-01/stablecoin-issuer-circle-files-publicly-for-ipo-as-revenue-grows). It has previously filed confidentially, but [its prospectus](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1876042/000119312525070481/d737521ds1.htm) is available now. It is an interesting read, and it has caused me to update my model of stablecoins in two respects:
> 
> 1. Circle is not an unregulated bank; it is a tech front-end for US banks and asset managers.[2](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/newsletters/2025-04-02/stablecoins-are-growing-up?cmpid=BBD040225_MONEYSTUFF&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_term=250402&utm_campaign=moneystuff&sref=6rqLu4ZS#footer-ref-footnote-2)
> 2. I am not as sure as I once was about “non-interest-paying.”

#### AI Ambivalence

Great articulation of how it is like to use AI for software development.

> Imagine you’re a Studio Ghibli artist. You’ve spent years perfecting your craft, you love the feeling of the brush/pencil in your hand, and your life’s joy is to make beautiful artwork to share with the world. And then someone tells you gen-AI can [just spit out](https://carly.substack.com/p/everything-is-ghibli) _My Neighbor Totoro_ for you. Would you feel grateful? Would you rush to drop your art supplies and jump head-first into the role of AI babysitter?
> 
> This is how I feel using gen-AI: like a babysitter. It spits out reams of code, I read through it and try to spot the bugs, and then we repeat. Although of course, as [Cory Doctorow points out](https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/30/a-neck-in-a-noose/), the temptation is to not even try to spot the bugs, and instead just let your eyes glaze over and let the machine do the thinking for you – the [full dream](https://vibemanifesto.org/) of vibe coding.
> 
> I do believe that this is the end state of this kind of development: “giving into the vibes,” not even trying to use your feeble primate brain to understand the code that the AI is barfing out, and instead to let other barf-generating “agents” evaluate its output for you. I’ll accept that maybe, _maybe_, if you have the right orchestra of agents that you’re conducting, then maybe you can cut down on the bugs, hallucinations, and repetitive boilerplate that gen-AI seems prone to. But whatever you’re doing at that point, it’s not software development, at least not the kind that I’ve known for the past ~20 years.

The entire conclusion section is worth reading as well. Here is the ending
