#### Matt Levine on Stablecoins
[Stablecoins Are Growing Up - Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/newsletters/2025-04-02/stablecoins-are-growing-up) #stablecoin #money #finance #crypto 

> I have always thought of stablecoins as basically unregulated non-interest-paying crypto banks. The idea of a stablecoin is that there is a company, the stablecoin issuer, and you send the company dollars, and it gives you back tokens (“stablecoins”). Each token is supposed to be worth a dollar, and if you hand the issuer back a token it will hand you back a dollar.[1](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/newsletters/2025-04-02/stablecoins-are-growing-up?cmpid=BBD040225_MONEYSTUFF&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_term=250402&utm_campaign=moneystuff&sref=6rqLu4ZS#footer-ref-footnote-1) But mostly you hold onto the stablecoins and the issuer holds onto your dollars. You both arguably benefit from this:
> 
> - You can use the tokens like dollars on in crypto applications, where actual dollars are hard to use: The stablecoins live natively on various crypto blockchains, can be sent over the blockchain, can be used in smart contracts, etc., in ways that don’t really work with dollars held in bank accounts.
> - The issuer has the dollars, which it can invest in super-safe short-dated US Treasury bills, _or anything else_, to make money. It doesn’t pay you any interest; any profit it makes from its investing is the issuer’s to keep.
> 
> But yesterday Circle Internet Group Inc., the big US-based issuer of the USDC stablecoin, [filed publicly for an initial public offering](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-01/stablecoin-issuer-circle-files-publicly-for-ipo-as-revenue-grows). It has previously filed confidentially, but [its prospectus](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1876042/000119312525070481/d737521ds1.htm) is available now. It is an interesting read, and it has caused me to update my model of stablecoins in two respects:
> 
> 1. Circle is not an unregulated bank; it is a tech front-end for US banks and asset managers.[2](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/newsletters/2025-04-02/stablecoins-are-growing-up?cmpid=BBD040225_MONEYSTUFF&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_term=250402&utm_campaign=moneystuff&sref=6rqLu4ZS#footer-ref-footnote-2)
> 2. I am not as sure as I once was about “non-interest-paying.”
