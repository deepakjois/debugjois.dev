#### The Return of Romanticism
[We Really Are Entering a New Age of Romanticism](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/we-really-are-entering-a-new-age) #culture 

An article from Ted Gioia which gave me a lot of hope.

> In the old days, movie villains were mobsters or crime syndicates. Nowadays they are _tech innovators_. This kind of shift in the popular imagination does not happen by chance.
> 
> Now let’s revisit the (even older) history.
> 
> Back in the 1700s, ruthless algorithms had a different name. They called them Rationalism—and the whole Western world was under the sway of the Age of Reason. But like today’s algorithms, the new systems of the Rationalists attempted to replace human wisdom and experience with intrusive and inflexible operating rules.
> 
> It didn’t work.
> 
> “This rationalistic philosophy, which had been expected to solve all the problems, had failed to rescue society from either despotism and poverty,” explains Edmund Wilson in his masterful study _To the Finland Station_.
> 
> “The mechanical inventions of which it had been expected that they would vastly improve the lot of humanity were obviously making many people miserable,” he continues.
> 
> (By the way, it’s no coincidence that recent tech overreach has been accompanied by a [New Rationalism](https://davidzmorris.substack.com/p/whats-so-bad-about-rationalism), championed by crypto swindler Sam Bankman-Fried and his many fellow travelers. But that subject deserves a whole article of its own….Now let’s return to history.)
> 
> The Rationalists of the 1700s (and today) put their faith in three things—and they all backfired.
> 
> (1) The most obvious failure was the attempt to impose rational rules on the political system. This led to the French Revolution, which soon collapsed in terrible bloodshed, and resulted in the dictatorship of Napoleon.
> 
> Millions of people died because the dominant algorithms didn’t work.
> 
> (2) The second obsession of the Rationalists in the 1700s was the total systematization of all knowledge. (Does that sound familiar?)
> 
> They didn’t have ChatGPT back then. But they did the best they could with the immense efforts of the [French Encyclopedists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A9distes) and [German taxonomists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:German_taxonomists).
> 
> Everything got classified, codified, quantified, named, and placed on a chart. Foucault later mocked this as an “archeology of human sciences.”
> 
> Everything was forced into the system—even (or especially) humans.
> 
> That’s because this way of understanding the world failed to grasp anything that evolved or grew or changed or lived. Like the tech-gone-wild ethos of the current day, the messy human element was removed from the Rationalist systems.
> 
> (3) But the Rationalists of the 1700s made one more mistake—and it reminds us again of our current situation. They let a brutal technocracy destroy people’s lives—driven by dreams of profit maximization, and ignoring the human cost.
> 
> It wasn’t called Silicon Valley back then. The name given to the technocracy in the 1700s was the _Industrial Revolution_.
> 
> We don’t fully grasp the horrors of the factory sweat shops today—because the Romanticists worked on fixing the problems of industrialism in the 1820s and 1830s. This new generation of artists, humanists, and compassionate critics of the technocracy passed laws against child labor, unsafe working conditions, abusive hours, and other exploitative practices.
> 
> In other words, the _Romanticists replaced the algorithm with humanist values_. Rationalism on its own would never do that.

Decided to watch this video series from [Canva's Design School](https://www.canva.com/designschool/) collection on a whim. Finally took the time to properly go through the color theory stuff which is well explained.
