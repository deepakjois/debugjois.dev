#### Social Media and Health Awareness
[Are you actually as unhealthy as you think? | Dazed](https://www.dazeddigital.com/beauty/article/66443/1/are-you-as-unhealthy-as-you-think-tiktok-wellness-hormones-cortisol)

> This comes through in the marketing where words like “essential” make taking a supplement like sea moss, a red seaweed being promoted for its “92 essential minerals”, seem vital for full body regeneration. In reality, however, there are actually only [13 consumable minerals necessary for human functions](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/vitamins-and-minerals), not 92. If you don’t know at least some of the minerals you’re taking, what they do, or if you’re even deficient in any of them, is gagging down a spoonful before breakfast every morning really the epitome of health? And worse, does not taking it make you think you’re less healthy than you are?

> Orthorexia nervosa, a disorder defined by the NIH as [an attempt to attain optimum health](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6370446/#:~:text=Orthorexia%20nervosa%20is%20perhaps%20best,and%20poor%20quality%20of%20life.) through attention to diet, was first coined in 1997 by Steven Bratman, MD, American physician and author. Over the last few years, eating-disorder treatment centers have been [reporting a rise in cases](https://airmail.news/look/issues/2024-8-2/when-healthy-eating-goes-too-far), with studies finding that [higher Instagram use](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314161589_Instagram_use_is_linked_to_increased_symptoms_of_orthorexia_nervosa) was associated with a greater tendency towards orthorexia nervosa. It can be difficult to notice and easy to hide, especially since obsessively healthy eating is seen as a superior habit, hidden behind moralistic and virtuous adjectives related to “cleanliness”.

> The truth is, you’re probably not as unhealthy as social media makes you think. No, you don’t have to choke down a spoonful of sea moss to earn a healthier life, go on a [meat-only diet](https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/64410/1/how-animal-based-eating-infiltrated-wellness-from-the-manosphere) to cure assumed deficiencies, or feed into a $700 handful of [pre-breakfast supplements](https://www.dazeddigital.com/beauty/article/62276/1/are-supplements-a-scam-bella-hadid-wellness-routine-trend#:~:text=But%20among%20medical%20professionals%2C%20the,is%20otherwise%20in%20good%20health.) to “balance hormones”. “While it’s great that people are paying attention to their health, the wellness industry tends to exaggerate problems, making people feel like they’re more unwell than they are,” Crum says. “The fundamentals of good health –adequate protein, fibre, hydration, sleep, and stress management – are far more effective than any single supplement.”

#### An elegy to a pencil
[an elegy for the pencil - by Adam Aleksic](https://etymology.substack.com/p/an-elegy-for-the-pencil) #pencil #writing #tools 

> Indeed, the experience of writing by hand is increasingly on its way out. [Schoolchildren are no longer learning cursive](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/jan/21/signature-moves-are-we-losing-the-ability-to-write-by-hand), as computers are integrated ever earlier into the classroom. White-collar jobs are revolving more around screens than printed paper. At a certain point in the future, the pencil is going to feel as obsolete as the stone and chisel. That’s just the way technological change works.

> Faulkner, Steinbeck, Atwood, Nabokov, and Morrison have all expressed a [preference for pencil and notebook](https://www.literaturelust.com/post/why-great-authors-often-choose-to-write-with-pencils)—preferences which surely shaped their ultimate contributions to our collective identity. There’s nothing “childish” about that.

#### Bubblegum Dystopia
[Why do we feel like we can afford more things while being stressed about the cost of living? - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/q69MhVIPm8I) #economics #cost #luxuries

Claude Summary:

> **The Shift in Value Between Necessities and Luxuries**
> 
> The core insight is about a fundamental economic shift in the relative cost of necessities versus luxuries over the past several decades:
> 
> In the 1970s:
> 
> - A TV cost about $500 (10% of a house down payment)
> - A house down payment was around $532
> - One TV = approximately 10% of a house down payment
> 
> Today:
> 
> - A TV still costs about $500 (0.5% of a house down payment)
> - A house down payment is around $102,000
> - One TV = approximately 0.5% of a house down payment
> 
> This explains why:
> 
> 1. Older generations view younger people as "financially irresponsible" for buying luxuries - they're applying outdated economic ratios
> 2. People today can simultaneously have many consumer goods while struggling with basic living expenses
> 3. Necessities (housing, healthcare, food) have increased dramatically in price while consumer goods have become relatively cheaper
> 4. This creates a "bubblegum dystopia" where people live with economic uncertainty and housing insecurity while surrounded by affordable entertainment and technology
> 
> The shift occurred because:
> 
> - Necessities have inelastic demand (people must pay regardless of price increases)
> - Companies selling non-necessities had to drive down costs through commodification to compete for the shrinking pool of disposable income
> - This results in more affordable luxuries but lower-quality, mass-produced items with "no soul"

#### More vs Extra
[Always do Extra - Ben Northrop](https://www.bennorthrop.com/Essays/2021/always-do-extra.php) #self-improvement 

> But aren't More and Extra the same thing? No! They sound similar, but they're actually very different. Here's a simple example:
> 
> Say for this sprint you're assigned two form screens that take user input and then persist it to the database. Pretty straight-forward. This is your Normal Work - the default expectation of what you need to get done to be in good standing on your project.
> 
> Doing More would be completing those two screens and then taking on a third screen that's just like it. Yes, this would help move the project along faster and make your manager happy, and that's great, but in the long-run, More doesn't give _you_ much.
> 
> Extra is different than More. Extra is finishing those two screens, but then researching a new library for form validation that might reduce the boilerplate code. Or it's learning ways to protect against common security vulnerabilities from data entry. These little off-ramps from the main highway of Normal Work _could_ be dead-ends and not have any practical value to the project. But they might also be important contributions. And that's the thing with Extra. While the tangible value to the project is uncertain (it could be nothing this time or it could be something), **the value to _you_ is real**.

#### Evolutionary Stability: Revolution vs Renovation
[https://www.newsblur.com/newsletters/story/8083317:79711f](https://www.newsblur.com/newsletters/story/8083317:79711f) #revolution #renovation #stability

> “Renovation is the point of equilibrium between creation and destruction, saving what is valuable and discarding what is outmoded or dysfunctional. It entails a long march through society’s institutions at a pace of change our incremental natures can absorb. Renovation shepherds the new into the old, buffering the damage of dislocation which at first outweighs longer-term benefits … Its aim is transition through _evolutionary stability_, within societies and in relations among nation-states and global networks.”
>
> In short, evolutionary stability is the better bet for making change than the confident ineptitude of shock and awe tactics that impede it by arousing reactive resistance and rejection before any new approach to governance can take hold.
