#### Social Media and Health Awareness
[Are you actually as unhealthy as you think? | Dazed](https://www.dazeddigital.com/beauty/article/66443/1/are-you-as-unhealthy-as-you-think-tiktok-wellness-hormones-cortisol)

> This comes through in the marketing where words like “essential” make taking a supplement like sea moss, a red seaweed being promoted for its “92 essential minerals”, seem vital for full body regeneration. In reality, however, there are actually only [13 consumable minerals necessary for human functions](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/vitamins-and-minerals), not 92. If you don’t know at least some of the minerals you’re taking, what they do, or if you’re even deficient in any of them, is gagging down a spoonful before breakfast every morning really the epitome of health? And worse, does not taking it make you think you’re less healthy than you are?

> Orthorexia nervosa, a disorder defined by the NIH as [an attempt to attain optimum health](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6370446/#:~:text=Orthorexia%20nervosa%20is%20perhaps%20best,and%20poor%20quality%20of%20life.) through attention to diet, was first coined in 1997 by Steven Bratman, MD, American physician and author. Over the last few years, eating-disorder treatment centers have been [reporting a rise in cases](https://airmail.news/look/issues/2024-8-2/when-healthy-eating-goes-too-far), with studies finding that [higher Instagram use](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314161589_Instagram_use_is_linked_to_increased_symptoms_of_orthorexia_nervosa) was associated with a greater tendency towards orthorexia nervosa. It can be difficult to notice and easy to hide, especially since obsessively healthy eating is seen as a superior habit, hidden behind moralistic and virtuous adjectives related to “cleanliness”.

> The truth is, you’re probably not as unhealthy as social media makes you think. No, you don’t have to choke down a spoonful of sea moss to earn a healthier life, go on a [meat-only diet](https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/64410/1/how-animal-based-eating-infiltrated-wellness-from-the-manosphere) to cure assumed deficiencies, or feed into a $700 handful of [pre-breakfast supplements](https://www.dazeddigital.com/beauty/article/62276/1/are-supplements-a-scam-bella-hadid-wellness-routine-trend#:~:text=But%20among%20medical%20professionals%2C%20the,is%20otherwise%20in%20good%20health.) to “balance hormones”. “While it’s great that people are paying attention to their health, the wellness industry tends to exaggerate problems, making people feel like they’re more unwell than they are,” Crum says. “The fundamentals of good health –adequate protein, fibre, hydration, sleep, and stress management – are far more effective than any single supplement.”

#### An elegy to a pencil
[an elegy for the pencil - by Adam Aleksic](https://etymology.substack.com/p/an-elegy-for-the-pencil) #pencil #writing #tools 

> Indeed, the experience of writing by hand is increasingly on its way out. [Schoolchildren are no longer learning cursive](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/jan/21/signature-moves-are-we-losing-the-ability-to-write-by-hand), as computers are integrated ever earlier into the classroom. White-collar jobs are revolving more around screens than printed paper. At a certain point in the future, the pencil is going to feel as obsolete as the stone and chisel. That’s just the way technological change works.

> Faulkner, Steinbeck, Atwood, Nabokov, and Morrison have all expressed a [preference for pencil and notebook](https://www.literaturelust.com/post/why-great-authors-often-choose-to-write-with-pencils)—preferences which surely shaped their ultimate contributions to our collective identity. There’s nothing “childish” about that.

#### Bubblegum Dystopia
[Why do we feel like we can afford more things while being stressed about the cost of living? - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/q69MhVIPm8I) #economics #cost #luxuries

Claude Summary:

> **The Shift in Value Between Necessities and Luxuries**
> 
> The core insight is about a fundamental economic shift in the relative cost of necessities versus luxuries over the past several decades:
> 
> In the 1970s:
> 
> - A TV cost about $500 (10% of a house down payment)
> - A house down payment was around $532
> - One TV = approximately 10% of a house down payment
> 
> Today:
> 
> - A TV still costs about $500 (0.5% of a house down payment)
> - A house down payment is around $102,000
> - One TV = approximately 0.5% of a house down payment
> 
> This explains why:
> 
> 1. Older generations view younger people as "financially irresponsible" for buying luxuries - they're applying outdated economic ratios
> 2. People today can simultaneously have many consumer goods while struggling with basic living expenses
> 3. Necessities (housing, healthcare, food) have increased dramatically in price while consumer goods have become relatively cheaper
> 4. This creates a "bubblegum dystopia" where people live with economic uncertainty and housing insecurity while surrounded by affordable entertainment and technology
> 
> The shift occurred because:
> 
> - Necessities have inelastic demand (people must pay regardless of price increases)
> - Companies selling non-necessities had to drive down costs through commodification to compete for the shrinking pool of disposable income
> - This results in more affordable luxuries but lower-quality, mass-produced items with "no soul"

#### More vs Extra
[Always do Extra - Ben Northrop](https://www.bennorthrop.com/Essays/2021/always-do-extra.php) #self-improvement 

> But aren't More and Extra the same thing? No! They sound similar, but they're actually very different. Here's a simple example:
> 
> Say for this sprint you're assigned two form screens that take user input and then persist it to the database. Pretty straight-forward. This is your Normal Work - the default expectation of what you need to get done to be in good standing on your project.
> 
> Doing More would be completing those two screens and then taking on a third screen that's just like it. Yes, this would help move the project along faster and make your manager happy, and that's great, but in the long-run, More doesn't give _you_ much.
> 
> Extra is different than More. Extra is finishing those two screens, but then researching a new library for form validation that might reduce the boilerplate code. Or it's learning ways to protect against common security vulnerabilities from data entry. These little off-ramps from the main highway of Normal Work _could_ be dead-ends and not have any practical value to the project. But they might also be important contributions. And that's the thing with Extra. While the tangible value to the project is uncertain (it could be nothing this time or it could be something), **the value to _you_ is real**.

#### Evolutionary Stability: Revolution vs Renovation
[https://www.newsblur.com/newsletters/story/8083317:79711f](https://www.newsblur.com/newsletters/story/8083317:79711f) #revolution #renovation #stability

> “Renovation is the point of equilibrium between creation and destruction, saving what is valuable and discarding what is outmoded or dysfunctional. It entails a long march through society’s institutions at a pace of change our incremental natures can absorb. Renovation shepherds the new into the old, buffering the damage of dislocation which at first outweighs longer-term benefits … Its aim is transition through _evolutionary stability_, within societies and in relations among nation-states and global networks.”
>
> In short, evolutionary stability is the better bet for making change than the confident ineptitude of shock and awe tactics that impede it by arousing reactive resistance and rejection before any new approach to governance can take hold.

#### Indian Woman and The Patrilocal Trap
[Why is Indian Women's Welfare Devalued? - by Alice Evans](https://www.ggd.world/p/why-is-indian-womens-welfare-devalued)

> Through my interviews with men and women from across six Indian states, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Morocco and Turkey, I’ve developed the concept of “[The Patrilocal Trap](https://www.ggd.world/p/the-patrilocal-trap)”. Historically across Eurasia, sons inherited family assets and cared for elderly parents. Families maintained trusted networks through strategic marriages, socialising daughters to marry, please their in-laws, and stay put. Divorce is heavily stigmatised.
>
> If women are raised for loyalty and unable to credibly threaten exit, they may not necessarily challenge men’s patriarchal entitlements. Instead, she may quietly comply. These films brilliantly capture what quantitative research often misses: the systematic subordination of women's time, preferences, and wellbeing to men’s comfort and convenience.

#### Violence among hunter gathererers

> For the first 290,000 years of our species’ approximately 300,000 year history, everyone was a hunter gatherer. In _The Better Angels of Our Nature_, Steven Pinker argued that hunter gatherers were extremely violent. _Better Angels_ claims that _at least_ 14 percent of prehistoric hunter gatherers died violently. This equates to a violent death rate of at least 420 per 100,000 people per year, using [data on typical hunter gatherer mortality rates](https://gurven.anth.ucsb.edu/sites/secure.lsit.ucsb.edu.anth.d7_gurven/files/sitefiles/papers/GurvenKaplan2007pdr.pdf).
>
> This is a _much_ higher rate of violence than almost anywhere in the modern world in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. To put it in perspective, [global deaths from all types of violence between 2004–21 were around 8 per 100,000 people per year](https://www.smallarmssurvey.org/resource/global-violent-deaths-2021). Even [the most violent cities in the world today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_by_homicide_rate), in Northern Brazil, South Africa, and on the Mexican side of the US-Mexico border, have murder rates of only around 100 per 100,000 per year.
>
> The implication in _Better Angels_ is that the human mind evolved and developed in a world plagued by constant, endemic violence. 
>
> Our 2022 [study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4466809) examined both the ethnographic data – contemporary studies of groups that existed until some modern contact – and archeological data on hunter gatherer violence, much of which comes from data gathered after the publication of _Better Angels._ We reviewed [quantitative estimates of rates of violence in ethnographies](https://violencetrends.substack.com/i/83108177/what-data-is-available-for-rates-of-violence-among-hunter-gatherers), filtering for groups that are most representative of our pre-agricultural ancestors. Our [archeological estimates](https://violencetrends.substack.com/i/83108177/results-rates-of-lethal-violence-from-pre-agricultural-sites-in-the-gomez-et-al-dataset) are based on reanalyzing a dataset developed by [Gomez](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature19758) et al. (which was released after _Better Angels_ was published and has dozens of extra samples), which attempts to measure rates of violent death by looking for evidence of trauma to skeletal remains. [Our study](https://violencetrends.substack.com/p/violence-before-agriculture-full) produced estimates for lethal violence around four times lower than Pinker’s figures.

To repeat the key point: *[Our study](https://violencetrends.substack.com/p/violence-before-agriculture-full) produced estimates for lethal violence around four times lower than Pinker’s figures.*

> Although we think that our study advances the state of knowledge, it must be said that both the archaeological and anthropological (ethnographic) evidence are unusually shaky. The archaeological record for the pre-agricultural period is extremely sparse, and the anthropological evidence is limited and geographically biased.
