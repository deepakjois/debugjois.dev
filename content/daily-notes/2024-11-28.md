#### Why I left NYC
[why I left nyc - by Kasra - Bits of Wonder](https://www.bitsofwonder.co/p/why-i-left-nyc) #nyc #sf

This randomly showed up in my Twitter, but upon reading I found myself overcome with a feeling of melancholy. I could relate a lot to some of the things said in the article, in my own struggles to find a city/place where I could find my kind of people and feel a shared sense of community.

NYC is also one of my favorite cities in the world, but I never lived there long enough to appreciate the challenges of building community there

> in new york, everything felt transient. I constantly met new people, only to never see them again. everyone packs their social schedule, which makes it hard to make spontaneous plans, and some people pack their schedule with multiple social activities in a single night, which makes it hard to have the slow, several-hours-long hangouts I prefer. despite all the work I did to create [social spaces](https://www.instagram.com/midnightcafe.nyc/) that were not just about drinking in dark and loud spaces, it still felt like the “center of gravity” for social life was drinking in dark and loud spaces. I hosted tons of events, but the overlap between “my close friends” and “people who attend my events” was frustratingly small. I had friends in very different worlds, which is nice—but it felt like the worlds they were in were _too_ different, and trying to host one big party where all my friends would be in one place seemed like a recipe for awkwardness, and people not really “getting” each other.

> the transience was what got to me. I’ve always wanted something very simple: a small group of close friends that I see consistently, week after week. friends I feel comfortable just sitting with. friends I can make my stupid absurdist jokes with, friends who will prioritize me by setting aside an entire evening rather than just “let’s catch up between 7-8pm three tuesdays from now.” I had a semblance of that kind of community in new york for a while, but by the end of my time there it was nonexistent.
