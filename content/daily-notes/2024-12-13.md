#### Meditations for Mortals Day Eighteen
The chapter is titled _Allow other people their problems: On minding your own business_.

> “What I eventually figured out – not that it ever seems to get particularly easy – is that other people’s negative emotions are ultimately a problem that belongs to them. And you have to allow other people their problems. This is one more area in which the best thing to do, as a finite human with limited control, is usually not to meddle, but to let things be.”

> Before we go any further, it bears emphasizing that the people you’re worried might be angry with you or bored by you or disappointed in you almost never are. They’ve got their own troubles to worry about. According to stereotype, people-pleasers are self-effacing types, and yet there’s something strikingly grandiose about the notion that your boss, client or coworker has nothing better to do than pace up and down all day thinking bad thoughts about you – or that your presence at a social gathering has the power to ruin it for anyone else…

The speaker particularly highlights Silicon Valley as the epicenter of this "hustle culture," where the pressure to constantly innovate and multiply value has become all-consuming.
> 
> **The Cost of Constant Optimization**
> This section explores the paradox of optimization: the more we try to optimize every aspect of our lives, the more we rob ourselves of genuine satisfaction. The younger generation, in particular, has internalized this mindset, viewing any "wasted" time as a cardinal sin. This perpetual drive for improvement has led to a state of constant restlessness, where people are always looking ahead to the next goal rather than finding joy in the present moment.

#### The Gender Ideological Divide
I had [logged about male loneliness](https://www.debugjois.dev/daily-archive-2024-11#male-loneliness) in Nov. On similar lines, I came across this article from Jan 2024 in the FT: [A new global gender divide is emerging](https://on.ft.com/3Dd5ljL) #masculinity #gender

This was accompanied by an interesting X thread.
