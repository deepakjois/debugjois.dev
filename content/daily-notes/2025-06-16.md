#### ytt-mcp - MCP Server to fetch YouTube Transcripts
I built an MCP server today!! - [GitHub - deepakjois/ytt-mcp: MCP server to get YouTube transcripts](https://github.com/deepakjois/ytt-mcp/tree/main) #youtube #mcp #transcription 

I love how seamlessly I can integrate this with Raycast (see demo video in README page on Github).

The bonus was I really got deep into how `uv` and Python packaging works.

#### URL Shortening System
I really loved this dense Excalidraw diagram. Adding it here because I wanna come back to it for inspiration
