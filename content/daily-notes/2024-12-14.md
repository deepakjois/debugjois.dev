#### Bengaluru Literature Festival
Spent the day at the Bengaluru Literature Festival. Met friends, attended sessions and bought books. Fun!

Also tried a couple of places in Bengaluru I hadn't been to - the Crescent Rd branch of Nerlu Coffee, and this hole in the wall place called HVR Veg near Sampige Rd metro station.
