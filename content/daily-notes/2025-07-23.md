#### When curiosity doesn’t fit the world we’ve built

> However, three interconnected forces might be conspiring to push hypercuriosity toward its maladaptive expressions:
> 
> **1) Social media is designed to trigger but never satisfy our information-seeking drives.** Algorithms exploit our curiosity gaps (the space between what we know and want to know) and deliver just enough novelty to keep us scrolling. For hypercurious minds, this creates an endless loop of stimulation.
> 
> **2) Nonlinear exploration is discouraged in educational institutions.** Traditional education rewards sustained attention to predetermined tasks. The result is that many hypercurious kids feel miserable suppressing their natural curiosity rather than learn how to leverage it.
> 
> **3) Most modern workplaces measure value based on efficient output.** In high productivity + low creativity work environments, hypercurious employees might burn out and/or leave to become self-employed (which might be why there is [an association](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8023171/) between ADHD and entrepreneurship).
> 
> So how do we fix this? I believe solving this requires three fundamental shifts:
> 
> **1. Rewilding education.** We need to redesign learning environments to support hypercuriosity. This means welcoming neurodivergent thinking, embracing experimental learning, and encouraging nonlinear paths.
> 
> **2. Reclaiming attention.** The attention economy hijacks hypercuriosity. We must treat attention as a precious resource worth protecting both individually and culturally by resisting algorithmic distraction and setting boundaries around our focus.
> 
> **3. Reimagining technology.** Digital tools should support hypercuriosity, not exploit it. We need interfaces (including AI) that help us ask better questions, discover new information, connect ideas, and integrate knowledge.
