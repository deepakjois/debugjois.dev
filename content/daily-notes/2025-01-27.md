#### Netflix Strategy
Earlier this week I posted snippets from a podcast where the guest broke down Netflix's strategy since its inception and its effects on shaping movie culture.

Came across a couple more articles in a similar vein: #netflix #movies #culture

#### Millie Jaco on Dating
This is such an anguished rant: [in the bad place - by millie jaco - The Dybbuk Diaries](https://milliejaco.substack.com/p/in-the-bad-place) #dating #relationships 

> The whole enterprise is a particularly cynical grift that exploits people with much of the same anxiety as myself, though maybe not on such a pathological level. I do have a diagnosed and certified mental illness, but I see a lot of it in others who are also navigating the dating scene. The anxiety is a simple one: we are all desperate to love and be loved. We are all desperate for companionship. We are all also suffering from this psychic sickness where we are supposed to act like pretending you are in a relationship for three months but not actually calling it that won’t lead to feelings developing on at least one side, because you’ve been simulating that for an extended period of time. We’re supposed to pretend that cancelling on someone you have supposedly built a rapport with last minute because something or someone better came up is run-of-the-mill and not really fucking rude, actually, or that having sex with someone and blocking them the next day is normal and not despicable, dehumanising behaviour. We’re supposed to pretend that if a man is giving you the absolute bare minimum and treating you as if you are just a convenient vagina, then the onus is on the woman for entertaining that behaviour. For being delusional. For not realising that ‘he’s just not that into you, babes :/ ’.

> A sad byproduct of this avoidance of pain at all costs is a certain emotional numbing, which leads to a complete neutering of any heated, passionate, or particularly devastating matters of the heart. It is so evident in the way people now talk about heterosexual relationships in particular. Intensity early on is ‘lovebombing;’ communicating when you want to communicate is ‘double texting’ and therefore ‘chasing’ and therefore bad; steamy flings have become sterile ‘situationships.’ Leading someone on and manipulating them by showing just enough affection to give them false hope is ‘breadcrumbing.’

#### Media Literacy is Dead
[media literacy: dead and streaming - by nana](https://thejournalcatacombs.substack.com/p/media-literacy-dead-and-streaming) #culture #media 

> This isn’t even about the level of education either, as almost all my students are in private schools and should theoretically have access to some of the best resources and teaching available. Yet, I find myself working with seniors who struggle to extract the purpose of a text or identify its target audience, which are fundamental skills for any form of media analysis. These are students on the verge of entering university, yet many of them find it difficult to engage with texts beyond surface-level comprehension. They may excel in memorization or standardized test-taking, but when it comes to critical thinking; asking _**why**_ a text exists, _**who**_ it is meant for, and _**how**_ it seeks to influence its audience, there is a noticeable gap.

…

> Media literacy used to be about teaching people how to discern credible sources, evaluate biases, and critically analyze the content they consume. But in today’s fast-paced digital world, these skills are being replaced by shortcuts. Why critically evaluate a news article when a trending tweet condenses it into 280 characters? Why check the credibility of a source when ChatGPT can provide an answer in seconds?

#### Every Relationships is Parasocial Now

Introduction: A Generation Trapped in Survival

- The article begins with a reflection on modern disconnection and the loss of agency in contemporary life, likening our existence to a dreamlike, aimless state.
- Human power has been transferred to mediating technologies (e.g., AI, streaming platforms, online shopping), creating a fragmented and distracted existence.
- The medium itself, especially smartphones, has redefined how people interact and perceive power, exacerbating feelings of helplessness.

The Commodification of Life and Relationships

- Modern relationships and daily actions are quantified and turned into data—tracked, measured, and commodified.
- The marketplace prioritizes performance, surveillance, and the monetization of every human interaction, reducing people to objects within an economic system.
- Consumerism permeates all aspects of life, with individuals trading their emotions, actions, and data for societal participation.
- The author critiques the concept of "enhanced survival," where life becomes about endurance and routine rather than genuine, meaningful experience.

The Rise of Parasociality

- All relationships, even those between close friends, are partially mediated through digital interfaces (texts, likes, profiles), introducing a layer of parasociality.
- The author notes that most interactions lack the authenticity of face-to-face connections, instead being shaped by nostalgia, curated images, and commodified exchanges.
- Social media exacerbates this issue, as people present curated, performative versions of themselves rather than authentic ones.
- Relationships have become transactional, and the boundaries between genuine connection and performance blur.

The Role of Technology in Isolation

- Technology encourages parasocial interactions by prioritizing performative over authentic engagement.
- The digital sphere has infiltrated spaces traditionally reserved for human connection, such as concerts, parties, and even private moments.
- As a result, people feel increasingly alienated despite constant connectivity.
- The pandemic accelerated this trend, cementing digital interaction as a primary mode of connection.

Economic and Political Implications

- The global economy leverages parasocial dynamics, turning individuals into commodities to sustain declining hegemonies, particularly in the U.S.
- Cyber-neoliberalism transforms all social interaction into commodified exchange, extending surveillance and control into every facet of life.
- The United States' focus on immaterial production (e.g., social media, culture) as a response to China's rise further deepens this commodification of identity and interaction.
- The author critiques cryptofascism and digital nationalism, which reinforce the idea of allegiance to platforms and markets rather than to communities or shared humanity.

The Cultural Crisis of Meaning

- The pervasive focus on survival over living creates a vacuum of meaning, as people are disconnected from real joy, spontaneity, and togetherness.
- Historians may look back on this period as one defined by stagnation, where human potential was diminished by the dominance of commodified existence.
- The author argues that survival—reduced to an endless cycle of productivity and consumption—has replaced the pursuit of a truly lived life.

 Revolutionary Possibilities

- Despite the bleak outlook, the author holds onto hope that humanity can reclaim genuine connection and agency.
- The key lies in acknowledging and resisting the parasocial nature of modern relationships by prioritizing face-to-face interactions and non-digital forms of connection.
- Revolutionary change will require breaking free from the current techno-neoliberal system, rediscovering balance between online and offline life, and fostering authentic togetherness.

Call to Action: Reclaiming Humanity

- The article concludes with a call to reject the commodification of relationships and embrace genuine human connection.
- Suggestions include:
    - Sacrificing digital personas and curated selves to prioritize real interactions.
    - Shifting away from platforms driven by advertising and surveillance.
    - Valuing unmediated experiences over symbolic gestures or performative actions.
- By doing so, people can reclaim agency, rediscover meaningful relationships, and resist the dehumanizing forces of cyber-neoliberalism.

#### Cringey Powerful Men
[I knew one day I’d have to watch powerful men burn the world down – I just didn’t expect them to be such losers | Rebecca Shaw | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/16/i-knew-one-day-id-have-to-watch-powerful-men-burn-the-world-down-i-just-didnt-expect-them-to-be-such-losers) #masculinity #technology #culture 

> Whether I am engaging with the news, or with Musk tweeting constantly like a man with no job or friends, or with Zuckerberg sending out weird videos and appearing on Rogan, I am in pain. Not just because I don’t like what they are doing but because they are so incredibly, _painfully_ cringe.
>
> I knew that one day we might have to watch as capitalism and greed and bigotry led to a world where powerful men, deserving or not, would burn it all down. What I didn’t expect, and don’t think I could have foreseen, is how incredibly _cringe_ it would all be. I have been prepared for evil, for greed, for cruelty, for injustice – but I did not anticipate that the people in power would also be such huge losers.

…

> Climate crises keep coming, genocides continue, women keep getting murdered, art is being strangled to death by AI, bigotry is on the rise, social progress is being rolled back … AND these men insist on being cringe? It’s a rotten cherry on top. This combination of evil and embarrassment is a unique horror, one that science fiction has failed to prepare us for. The second-hand embarrassment we have to endure gets even more potent when combined with other modern influences on young men, like [Jordan Peterson](https://www.theguardian.com/books/jordan-peterson) and Andrew Tate.
