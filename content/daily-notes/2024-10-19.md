Have been a bit behind on updating my podcasts, so am gonna just add all the ones I didn't add the past few days #podcasts:
- [‘Nobody Wants This’ Review: Fake Podcasting, Icks, and a Hot Rabbi - The Ringer](https://www.theringer.com/2024/10/15/24271298/nobody-wants-this-review-fake-podcasting-icks-hot-rabbi) - Good analysis of the show. It's probably not the kind of show that deserves an episode-by-episode breakdown, so it was nice to have one episode that touched upon the key themes.
- [Theobroma's dilemma: how to continue scaling while staying true to the 'artisanal' identity](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/daybreak/theobromas-dilemma-how-to-n6kfsZbpyBz/) - The main topic was kinda mid, but the Thu Daybreak podcasts has a segment called _Daybreak Unwind_ which have been top class so far. This time the segment was on Indian folk songs.
- [Transcript: Culture Chat — The FT takes on ‘Industry’ season 3](https://www.ft.com/content/d84b00d9-4707-4184-ac8e-85d3de67d536) - The vibe of this show was very different from the episode recaps (on three different podcasts!) and reddit forums that I normally track. Some of the takes seemed off-base as well.
- [Nobel-Prize Special | Daron Acemoglu on Why We Should Celebrate Humanity | On Humans Podcast \~ Science & Philosophy of What It Means To Be Human](https://on-humans.podcastpage.io/episode/nobel-prize-special-daron-acemoglu-on-why-we-should-celebrate-humanity) - A repost of snippets from a 2023 podcast episode which is relevant now because Acemoglu just won the Nobel. I posted a ChatGPT summary of the transcript below

#### Darren Acemoglu on the On Humans podcast
Summary of key themes generated by ChatGPT

- **Inclusive Institutions and Technological Progress:** Acemoglu revisits his earlier work in _Why Nations Fail_, emphasizing that inclusive institutions enable technological advancements that benefit society. However, he adds a new dimension, focusing on the _direction_ of technology as a critical factor in today’s economy.
    
- **Power Structures and Technology:** While technological adoption is key to prosperity, Acemoglu stresses the growing issue of power concentration in the hands of tech elites, particularly in Silicon Valley. This “persuasive power” shapes societal views on technology and inequality, sometimes to the detriment of the public good.
    
- **Automation and Inequality:** The conversation highlights how automation has contributed to wage stagnation for a large portion of the U.S. workforce, particularly men without college degrees. Acemoglu argues that automation, if not balanced with new opportunities for human skills, can lead to further societal divides.
    
- **Prohuman Technological Change:** Acemoglu advocates for “prohuman” technology, which enhances human capabilities rather than sidelining workers. He praises Germany’s approach to using robotics in a way that complements human labor, contrasting it with the U.S. model where automation often displaces workers.
    
- **The Role of Unions and Institutional Design:** A cooperative relationship between labor and management, as seen in countries like Germany and Sweden, allows for better integration of technology and human labor. This contrasts with more conflictual labor relations in the U.S. and U.K., which hinder such collaboration.
