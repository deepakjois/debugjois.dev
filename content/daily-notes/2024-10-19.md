Have been a bit behind on updating my podcasts, so am gonna just add all the ones I didn't add the past few days #podcasts:
- [‘Nobody Wants This’ Review: Fake Podcasting, Icks, and a Hot Rabbi - The Ringer](https://www.theringer.com/2024/10/15/24271298/nobody-wants-this-review-fake-podcasting-icks-hot-rabbi) - Good analysis of the show. It's probably not the kind of show that deserves an episode-by-episode breakdown, so it was nice to have one episode that touched upon the key themes.
- [Theobroma's dilemma: how to continue scaling while staying true to the 'artisanal' identity](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/daybreak/theobromas-dilemma-how-to-n6kfsZbpyBz/) - The main topic was kinda mid, but the Thu Daybreak podcasts has a segment called _Daybreak Unwind_ which have been top class so far. This time the segment was on Indian folk songs.
- [Transcript: Culture Chat — The FT takes on ‘Industry’ season 3](https://www.ft.com/content/d84b00d9-4707-4184-ac8e-85d3de67d536) - The vibe of this show was very different from the episode recaps (on three different podcasts!) and reddit forums that I normally track. Some of the takes seemed off-base as well
