Finally ended up watching this show. Now catching with all the internet think pieces on it!

> It’s true that those of us on social media – [that’s 98 per cent of us Gen Zers](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1401041/uk-social-media-users-by-generation/) – are entirely at the mercy of algorithms. Major platforms like TikTok remain maddeningly opaque about exactly how their algorithms work, but it’s not difficult to spot patterns in what they choose to recommend. Speaking to the [BBC in 2024](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gdqzxypdzo), Andrew Kaung, a former analyst at TikTok, algorithms are designed to fuel engagement by showing you content which you’re inclined to spend longer watching. Often, this sort of thumb-stopping content is extremist in nature; independent research and reporting has consistently found that social media algorithms amplify [misogynistic](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2024/feb/social-media-algorithms-amplify-misogynistic-content-teens) and [inflammatory](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jul/27/tiktoks-algorithm-is-highly-sensitive-and-could-send-you-down-a-hate-filled-rabbit-hole-before-you-know-it) content.

> But while it is impossible for parents to ensure their children are forever shielded from the likes of Andrew Tate, there’s no reason why this problem can’t be tackled at the root. If parents and teachers are powerless to adequately monitor the kind of content children are consuming online, why can’t social media companies do something? Why can’t misogynistic content be removed from platforms before it has a chance to poison impressionable young minds? It’s a question worth asking, but one _Adolescence_ fails to pose. Instead the show meekly throws its hands up in defeat. “You can’t keep an eye on them all the time, love. We just can’t,” Eddie says.

#### Typing Practise

> Typing Practice 2
> 
> If you’re from the video welcome! The following is the exact instructions I gave our team to follow for 1 work week which is why you’ll see instructions to record scores for each day. Enjoy!
> 
> For the next 5 work days dedicate 20 minutes a day to doing these practice exercises.
> 
> - 10 minutes before lunch, 10 minutes after lunch.
> - You can break these 10 minutes up, but please make sure you’re doing at least 20 minutes a day.
> - During all of these tests you should be trying your hardest to never look at your keyboard. Try to focus on not looking during regular work day typing as well.
> - Focus on accuracy over speed at all times, even when you’re taking tests at the end of each day.
> - Use the same keyboard for all of this practice.
> 
> NOTES:
> 
> - Try to do all of these activities at least once unless they seem too hard.
> - I’d suggest starting with an easy activity first and then moving onto the harder ones.
> - At the end of each day, go to Monkeytype and take 5x 15 second tests. Record your best score each day.
> 
> First

> 
> - Read all the instructions before you start.
> - Create an account to keep track of progress.
> - Unlock all letters as green before moving on

#### Case for Living Online
[Tyler Cowen: The Case for Living Online - by Tyler Cowen](https://www.thefp.com/p/the-case-for-living-online) #online #culture 

> Why do I spend so much of my time with email, group chats, and also writing for larger audiences such as _Free Press_ readers? I ask myself that earnestly, and I have arrived at a pretty good answer. I believe that by spending time online I will meet and befriend a collection of individuals around the world, who are pretty much exactly the people I want to be in touch with. And then I will be in touch with them regularly.
> 
> I call them “the perfect people for me.”
> 
> I recognize that many of these communications are online, and thus they are “thinner” than many more local, face-to-face relationships. Yet I do end up meeting most of these people, and with great pleasure. That, in turn, enhances the quality of the online communications. And frankly, if forced to choose, I would rather have thinner relationships with “the perfect people for me” than regular bear hugs and beer guzzlings with “people who are in the 87th percentile for me.”
> 
> The internet, in other words, has invented a new means of human connection, characterized by “the perfect people for me.” For me, it’s people who are into analytical thinking and tech and AI and music and economics, and much more. For others? It can be _Survivor_ obsessives or vegans or knitters or _Survivor_ obsessives who are vegan and love to knit. The point is that there is a niche for all 8 billion of us. And now we know where to find each other.
> 
> And it turns out we value that very, very highly. So highly that we are willing to obsess over our little devices known as smartphones.

#### The renaissance of personal software
[The 70% problem: Hard truths about AI-assisted coding](https://addyo.substack.com/p/the-70-problem-hard-truths-about?r=17wsq&triedRedirect=true) #ai #programming

> I believe we're going to see a renaissance of personal software development. As the market gets flooded with AI-generated MVPs, the products that will stand out are those built by developers who:
> 
> - Take pride in their craft
> 
> - Care about the little details
> 
> - Focus on the full user experience
> 
> - Build for the edge cases
> 
> - Create truly self-serve experiences
> 
> The irony? AI tools might actually enable this renaissance. By handling the routine coding tasks, they free up developers to focus on what matters most - creating software that truly serves and delights users.

#### How to live like an Epicurean — 9 key habits
[How to live like an Epicurean — 9 key habits](https://postanly.substack.com/p/how-to-live-like-an-epicurean-9-key) #epicurean #philosophy

> If you’re looking for a way to live a more fulfilling or simpler life, living like an Epicurean might be the answer. Epicureanism is a philosophy that emphasises the importance of pursuing pleasure and avoiding pain to live a fulfilling life. However, this idea of pleasure was not limited to physical pleasure alone but also included intellectual pleasures such as knowledge and wisdom. It teaches that the greatest good is pleasure and the absence of pain.

1. **Focus on Inner Happiness**: Seek joy from within rather than external possessions.
2. **Practice Self-Control**: Master your emotions to achieve tranquility.
3. **Prioritize Meaningful Relationships**: Cultivate genuine friendships for support and happiness.
4. **Embrace the Present Moment**: Live fully in the now and enjoy simple pleasures.
5. **Seek Healthy Pleasures**: Find joy in virtuous living rather than excess.
6. **Cultivate a Mindfulness Practice**: Engage in meditation or reflection for greater self-awareness.
7. **Accept What You Cannot Control**: Let go of the need to control everything around you.
8. **Challenge Adversity**: View challenges as opportunities for growth and resilience.
9. **Live Moderately**: Avoid excess and focus on balanced choices that promote well-being.

#### Avoiding Skill Atrophy in the Age of AI
[Avoiding Skill Atrophy in the Age of AI - by Addy Osmani](https://addyo.substack.com/p/avoiding-skill-atrophy-in-the-age?r=17wsq&triedRedirect=true) #ai #software #programming 

Here are the key points from the section "Using AI as a collaborator, not a crutch":

- **Mindful Engagement** - Treat AI as a collaborator rather than an infallible tool. Engage actively with its outputs.
- **Practice AI Hygiene** - Always verify AI suggestions. Test and understand AI-generated code instead of accepting it blindly.
- **No AI for Fundamentals** - Reserve time for manual coding to strengthen foundational skills. Consider implementing "No-AI Days."
- **Attempt Problems Independently** - Try solving issues on your own before consulting AI. This enhances problem-solving skills.
- **Augment Code Review with AI** - Use AI to assist in code reviews but maintain human oversight to catch potential errors.
- **Active Learning** - Follow up on AI solutions to deepen understanding. Engage with AI by asking questions about its outputs.
- **Track AI Assistance** - Keep a record of frequent AI queries to identify knowledge gaps and areas for improvement.
- **Pair Programming with AI** - Collaborate with AI in a pair programming style to maintain control over the coding process.
- **Long-term Skill Preservation** - Ensure that reliance on AI does not lead to skill atrophy. Maintain curiosity and understanding of coding fundamentals.

These practices aim to leverage AI's advantages while preserving essential coding skills and critical thinking abilities.

#### "AI-first" is the new Return To Office
["AI-first" is the new Return To Office - Anil Dash](https://www.anildash.com//2025/04/19/ai-first-is-the-new-return-to-office/)

> Big tech CEOs and VCs really love performing for each other. We know they hang out in group chats like high schoolers, preening and sending each other texts, each trying to make sure they're all wearing the latest fashions, whether it's a gold chain or a MAGA hat or just repeating a phrase that they heard from another founder. A key way of showing that they're part of this cohort is to make sure they're having a tantrum and acting out against their workers fairly regularly.
> 
> The return to office fad was a big part of this effort, often largely motivated by reacting to the show of worker power in the racial justice activism efforts of 2020. Similarly, being AI-first shows that a company is participating in the AI trend in the "right" way, by imposing it on workers, rather than trusting workers to judge what tools are useful for them to do their jobs.

> There's an orthodoxy in tech tycoon circles that's increasingly referred to, ironically, as "tech optimism". I say "ironically", because there's nothing optimistic about it. The culture is one of deep insecurity, reacting defensively, or even lashing out aggressively, when faced with any critical conversation about new technology. That tendency is paired with a desperate and facile cheerleading of startups, ignoring the often equally interesting technologies stories that come from academia, or from mature industries, or from noncommercial and open source communities that don't get tons of media coverage, but quietly push forward innovating without the fame and fortune. By contrast, those of us who actually _are_ optimistic about technology (usually because we either create it, or are in communities with those who do) are just happily moving forward, not worrying when people point out the bugs that we all ought to be fixing together.

#### Reimagining Democracy
[Reimagining Democracy - Schneier on Security](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/04/reimagining-democracy-2.html) #democracy #politics

Bruce Schneier writes with a lot of clarity. The whole article is worth reading.

> Indeed, the very idea of representative government was a hack to get around technological limitations. Voting is easier now. Does it still make sense for all of us living in the same place to organize every few years and choose one of us to go to a single big room far away and make laws in our name? Representative districts are organized around geography because that was the only way that made sense two hundred-plus years ago. But we do not need to do it that way anymore. We could organize representation by age: one representative for the thirty-year-olds, another for the forty-year-olds, and so on. We could organize representation randomly: by birthday, perhaps. We can organize in any way we want. American citizens currently elect people to federal posts for terms ranging from two to six years. Would ten years be better for some posts? Would ten days be better for others? There are lots of possibilities. Maybe we can make more use of direct democracy by way of plebiscites. Certainly we do not want all of us, individually, to vote on every amendment to every bill, but what is the optimal balance between votes made in our name and ballot initiatives that we all vote on?
