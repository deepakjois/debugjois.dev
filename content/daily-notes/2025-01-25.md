> I often don't know how to respond to such questions, on account of my general incompetence. But I've realized that most of these folks have something in common: they're _stuck_. They’re looking for advice less in the sense of “any good restaurants around here?” and more in the sense of “everything kinda sucks right now and I’d like to change that but I don’t know how?”
> 
> Being stuck is the psychological equivalent of standing knee-deep in a fetid bog, bog in every direction, bog as far as the eye can see. You go wading in search of dry land and only find more bog. Nothing works, no options seem good, it’s all bleh and meh and ho hum and no thanks and _more bog_. This is the kind of dire situation that drives people to do crazy things like ask a blogger for advice.
> 
> Fortunately, I’ve spent much of my life in that very bog. Some say I was born in it, a beautiful bouncing baby bog boy. And I've learned that no matter how you ended up there—your marriage has stalled, you're falling behind in your classes, your trainee pilots keep flying into the side of a mountain—the forces that keep you in the bog are always the same. There are, in fact, only three, although they each come in a variety of foul flavors.

Based on the article, here is a summary of the different ways people get stuck:

1. **Insufficient Activation Energy**: This is when someone lacks the initial burst of effort needed to get out of a rut. It includes various subtypes:
   - **Gutterballing**: Excelling in a slightly wrong direction, ultimately leading to dissatisfaction.
   - **Waiting for Jackpot**: Holding out for a perfect solution without downsides, which rarely, if ever, happens.
   - **Declining the Dragon**: Knowing what needs to be done but being too afraid to act.
   - **The Mediocrity Trap**: Staying in a bad-but-not-too-bad situation due to its comfort zone, leading to a sense of lost years.
   - **Stroking the Problem**: Obsessively thinking about problems without actually addressing them.

2. **Bad Escape Plan**: Even with sufficient motivation, poor planning can lead to failure.
   - **The 'Try Harder' Fallacy**: Believing that merely wanting a situation to change will make it so.
   - **Infinite Effort Illusion**: Assuming you have a hidden reserve of effort to tap into when needed.
   - **Blaming God**: Focusing on unchangeable aspects of a situation.
   - **Diploma Problems vs. Toothbrushing Problems**: Misunderstanding the nature of a problem (one-time vs. ongoing).
   - **Fantastical Metamorphosis**: Expecting to suddenly become a person who doesn't have the current issues.
   - **Puppeteering**: Trying to solve problems by controlling others’ actions.

3. **A Bog of One's Own**: Self-imposed mental traps.
   - **Floor is Lava**: Creating and losing at self-imposed mental games.
   - **Super Surveillance**: Obsessively monitoring problems without addressing them.
   - **Hedgehogging**: Refusing to be influenced by others even when beneficial.
   - **Personal Problems Growth Ray**: Viewing your own problems as insurmountable compared to others'.
   - **Obsessing Over Tiny Predictors**: Focusing on insignificant details as a means of control.
   - **Impossible Satisfaction**: Believing that satisfaction or a good life is unattainable.

The article highlights the importance of recognizing these patterns to find solid ground and move towards a better situation.
