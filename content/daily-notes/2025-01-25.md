Based on the article, here is a summary of the different ways people get stuck:

1. **Insufficient Activation Energy**: This is when someone lacks the initial burst of effort needed to get out of a rut. It includes various subtypes:
   - **Gutterballing**: Excelling in a slightly wrong direction, ultimately leading to dissatisfaction.
   - **Waiting for Jackpot**: Holding out for a perfect solution without downsides, which rarely, if ever, happens.
   - **Declining the Dragon**: Knowing what needs to be done but being too afraid to act.
   - **The Mediocrity Trap**: Staying in a bad-but-not-too-bad situation due to its comfort zone, leading to a sense of lost years.
   - **Stroking the Problem**: Obsessively thinking about problems without actually addressing them.

2. **Bad Escape Plan**: Even with sufficient motivation, poor planning can lead to failure.
   - **The 'Try Harder' Fallacy**: Believing that merely wanting a situation to change will make it so.
   - **Infinite Effort Illusion**: Assuming you have a hidden reserve of effort to tap into when needed.
   - **Blaming God**: Focusing on unchangeable aspects of a situation.
   - **Diploma Problems vs. Toothbrushing Problems**: Misunderstanding the nature of a problem (one-time vs. ongoing).
   - **Fantastical Metamorphosis**: Expecting to suddenly become a person who doesn't have the current issues.
   - **Puppeteering**: Trying to solve problems by controlling othersâ€™ actions.

3. **A Bog of One's Own**: Self-imposed mental traps.
   - **Floor is Lava**: Creating and losing at self-imposed mental games.
   - **Super Surveillance**: Obsessively monitoring problems without addressing them.
   - **Hedgehogging**: Refusing to be influenced by others even when beneficial.
   - **Personal Problems Growth Ray**: Viewing your own problems as insurmountable compared to others'.
   - **Obsessing Over Tiny Predictors**: Focusing on insignificant details as a means of control.
   - **Impossible Satisfaction**: Believing that satisfaction or a good life is unattainable.

The article highlights the importance of recognizing these patterns to find solid ground and move towards a better situation.
