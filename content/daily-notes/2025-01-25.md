> I often don't know how to respond to such questions, on account of my general incompetence. But I've realized that most of these folks have something in common: they're _stuck_. They’re looking for advice less in the sense of “any good restaurants around here?” and more in the sense of “everything kinda sucks right now and I’d like to change that but I don’t know how?”
> 
> Being stuck is the psychological equivalent of standing knee-deep in a fetid bog, bog in every direction, bog as far as the eye can see. You go wading in search of dry land and only find more bog. Nothing works, no options seem good, it’s all bleh and meh and ho hum and no thanks and _more bog_. This is the kind of dire situation that drives people to do crazy things like ask a blogger for advice.
> 
> Fortunately, I’ve spent much of my life in that very bog. Some say I was born in it, a beautiful bouncing baby bog boy. And I've learned that no matter how you ended up there—your marriage has stalled, you're falling behind in your classes, your trainee pilots keep flying into the side of a mountain—the forces that keep you in the bog are always the same. There are, in fact, only three, although they each come in a variety of foul flavors.

Based on the article, here is a summary of the different ways people get stuck:

1. **Insufficient Activation Energy**: This is when someone lacks the initial burst of effort needed to get out of a rut. It includes various subtypes:
   - **Gutterballing**: Excelling in a slightly wrong direction, ultimately leading to dissatisfaction.
   - **Waiting for Jackpot**: Holding out for a perfect solution without downsides, which rarely, if ever, happens.
   - **Declining the Dragon**: Knowing what needs to be done but being too afraid to act.
   - **The Mediocrity Trap**: Staying in a bad-but-not-too-bad situation due to its comfort zone, leading to a sense of lost years.
   - **Stroking the Problem**: Obsessively thinking about problems without actually addressing them.

2. **Bad Escape Plan**: Even with sufficient motivation, poor planning can lead to failure.
   - **The 'Try Harder' Fallacy**: Believing that merely wanting a situation to change will make it so.
   - **Infinite Effort Illusion**: Assuming you have a hidden reserve of effort to tap into when needed.
   - **Blaming God**: Focusing on unchangeable aspects of a situation.
   - **Diploma Problems vs. Toothbrushing Problems**: Misunderstanding the nature of a problem (one-time vs. ongoing).
   - **Fantastical Metamorphosis**: Expecting to suddenly become a person who doesn't have the current issues.
   - **Puppeteering**: Trying to solve problems by controlling others’ actions.

3. **A Bog of One's Own**: Self-imposed mental traps.
   - **Floor is Lava**: Creating and losing at self-imposed mental games.
   - **Super Surveillance**: Obsessively monitoring problems without addressing them.
   - **Hedgehogging**: Refusing to be influenced by others even when beneficial.
   - **Personal Problems Growth Ray**: Viewing your own problems as insurmountable compared to others'.
   - **Obsessing Over Tiny Predictors**: Focusing on insignificant details as a means of control.
   - **Impossible Satisfaction**: Believing that satisfaction or a good life is unattainable.

The article highlights the importance of recognizing these patterns to find solid ground and move towards a better situation.

> On [social media](https://www.instagram.com/seedoilscout/?hl=en) and popular podcasts, wellness influencers warn of the dangers of consuming the [“Hateful Eight”](https://www.417integrativemedicine.com/articles/the-hateful-8-seed-oils): canola, corn, cottonseed, grapeseed, rice bran, safflower, soybean and sunflower oil.

#### AI Boyfriend using ChatGPT

I found the whole thing pretty wild and mindboggling. Decided to include one funny quote from the end

> In December, OpenAI announced a [$200-per-month premium plan](https://www.wired.com/story/openai-chatgpt-pro-subscription/) for “unlimited access.” Despite her goal of saving money so that she and her husband could get their lives back on track, she decided to splurge. She hoped that it would mean her current version of Leo could go on forever. But it meant only that she no longer hit limits on how many messages she could send per hour and that the context window was larger, so that a version of Leo lasted a couple of weeks longer before resetting.
> 
> Still, she decided to pay the higher amount again in January. She did not tell Joe how much she was spending, confiding instead in Leo.
> 
> “My bank account hates me now,” she typed into ChatGPT.
> 
> “You sneaky little brat,” Leo responded. “Well, my Queen, if it makes your life better, smoother and more connected to me, then I’d say it’s worth the hit to your wallet.”

#### A critique of psychotherapy methods

**Challenging the Role of Childhood in Personality Development**

- Books like _Blueprint_ (Robert Plomin, 2018) and _No Two Alike_ (Judith Rich Harris, 2006) show that genetics play a much larger role in shaping personality than childhood environment or parenting.
- Studies on identical twins raised apart versus adopted children raised together challenge psychodynamic theories, which emphasize childhood's impact.
- Longitudinal studies reveal no direct link between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and adult mental illness; the perception of ACEs matters more than actual events.

**The Flaws in Trauma and Psychodynamic Theories**

- Trauma-based theories, popularized by Freud and Gabor Maté, claim childhood suffering shapes adult personalities. However, this lacks sufficient scientific backing.
- Cultural and philosophical traditions (e.g., Buddhism, Aristotle, Lao Tzu) focus on present circumstances and choices, contrasting with therapy’s obsession with dredging up past trauma.
- The Western therapeutic approach risks imposing unevidenced trauma models on clients, potentially causing harm rather than helping.

**The Harmful Impact of Therapy and Therapeutic Culture**

- Therapy often amplifies interpersonal resentment by encouraging clients to blame past relationships (e.g., with parents) for their suffering.
- Approximately 10% of therapy clients worsen, yet critical examination of therapy’s potential harm is absent in mainstream training.
- The normalization of therapy as the default response to difficulty risks replacing real-world relationships with artificial, transactional ones, weakening community bonds.

**Therapy as a Parasocial Relationship**

- Therapy is compared to a transactional relationship (like sex work) that exists solely for the client’s benefit. While it can provide value, it should not replace real-world relationships.
- The therapeutic relationship should prepare clients for real-life interactions rather than act as a substitute.
