#### Book Recos as Hinge Prompt
[NPR Books Newsletter](https://view.nl.npr.org/?qs=faf2840604d8f2d7087ae952d0c0158f432cda88aa585e0eb41937a32dd2ed351aad896e23a67531b6852e3b2a92c6275f9431e46c117cfe5e061cc3a998bfc5addd35c636df06ce074f91d64b401702a63a4a812a667977) #hinge #dating #books 

> Because I live in Baltimore, of course I’m familiar with that [John Waters quote](https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=818ebb282d3945a46d0322a4837a929f5ffd0628eeb4e8e6f82dbc7468cd29002cbef34e0102efeeb5ba35f378c7594bfac936bebde6769fc804df5fa72f6c6c): “If you go home with somebody and they don’t have books, don’t f— ‘em.” You see the line on tote bags and stickers all across this city. And I understand the point of trying to _Lysistrata_ our way into making reading “cool.” But I’ve always been uncomfortable using books, or bookishness, as a proxy for judging people as people.
> 
> And yet, earlier this week, NPR posted [this video on Instagram](https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=818ebb282d3945a4effa1e2103ac70f38aa8594b0d9d05b68fa7da92fdae48eb80acc70465fab7fa877af5d473b1a5d20b264838a73c24c1d49bf41e345ef634) featuring me talking with one of our video producers, Wendy Li, about a peculiar Hinge prompt of hers. In it, she asked potential suitors to recommend a book. Which seemed simple enough to me – someone naive to what dating apps in 2025 are like. Obviously, dudes ended up using this prompt not to earnestly talk about books they loved, but instead trying to … I dunno, impress? Which led to certain books (_The Catcher in the Rye, A Court of Thorn and Roses_ and others) becoming red flags for Wendy.

#### Unhingedness
[on one-sidedness - by Ava - bookbear express](https://www.avabear.xyz/p/on-one-sidedness) #unhinged #personality #dating #novel

> I saw this video of Deleuze saying that someone’s charm lies in their [unhingedness](https://www.instagram.com/__nitch/p/DBmaUdeJh8U/). And I think with every passing year I’m like, yeah, it’s actually okay to be sort of unhinged, _especially_ if it’s a private experience. Like feeling like you’re about to die because you’re so in love and then proceeding to not do anything about it actually this amazing experience to live through and there’s a reason we make so much art about it.

The quote from the link:

> "The thing is, people only have charm through their madness…that is what is so difficult to understand. The real charm of a person is the side where they lose control a little, it is the side where they no longer really know where they are… That doesn’t mean they fall apart, on the contrary, these are people who don’t fall apart…but if you can’t grasp the root or seed of madness in someone, you can’t truly like them…you can’t truly love them. It’s the unhinged side, where we all are somewhat insane… If you don’t grasp one’s hint of insanity, the point where…I am afraid, or on the contrary, I am very happy…that point of madness is the very source of their charm."

The article links to a review by Adelle Waldman of a new book by Susan Minot titled _Don't be a Stranger_. 

> In a perceptive and original double [review](https://www.compactmag.com/article/the-sexting-of-the-shrew/) of _Don’t be a Stranger_ and Miranda July’s hit novel “All Fours” in the online magazine Compact, critic Valerie Stivers questions the familiar, pop-psych analysis Ivy has mostly embraced by the end of the book, a take that is of course premised on the largely untested — and untestable — idea that passes for wisdom in our culture as currently constituted: that our happiness is entirely internally derived and shouldn’t be dependent on other people. Such conclusions, Stivers writes,
> 
> _are terribly cynical, and also don’t seem right, given the passion and commitment of [both Minot’s and July’s novels] to describing the relationships, and given the commonness and perceived importance of exactly these tormenting human experiences. So what if both of these experiences were love—the genuine article? And what if this love proposed something right—a life ordered around a profound romantic, intimate, and sexual bond—instead of suggesting something wrong? What if the “problem” is not that [Ivy and the un-named protagonist of “All Fours”] can’t do monogamy or have a twisted, needy psychology, but that both, in an inchoate way, yearn for a better connection with a man and a more ideal family?_
> 
> I think Stivers is right. Sure, it _would_ have been better if Ivy hadn’t been so vulnerable to a jerk like Ansel Fleming. But learning to be more careful about not falling for jerks is not the same as learning—or trying to teach oneself—not to need _anyone_, not to need romantic love at all. And yet wide swaths of our culture have, it seems, embraced the idea that the desire for love and romance is something we should strive to overcome, or master, in the name of something like self-actualization. In fact — if we’re being real — we ought to acknowledge that self-actualization is a concept as little grounded in evidence as the belief in religious miracles, in that I’m pretty sure no one has ever witnessed self-actualization or knows what it looks like in practice. Rather, it always seems to be just around the corner, slightly out of reach, something this or that influencer or celebrity is about to attain now that he or she has finally realized this one new “truth” and has only to apply it, for all the pieces of their life to click into place. At least happiness in love — if rarer than we might like — is something we’ve all seen with our own eyes, if we haven’t experienced it ourselves.

Finally installed Raycast today, because I was looking for a way to activate text snippets. The free version looks pretty good for a lot that I would like to do.

#### Vibe Coding
Andrej Karpathy made an interesting tweet where he covers one kind of coding he is doing a lot with AI assistants

Found out about [SuperWhisper](https://superwhisper.com/) from the tweet, which I look forward to trying.

#### Texting over Phone Calls
[‘No, I’m not phoning to say I’m dying!’ My gruelling week of calling gen Z friends rather than texting them \| Life and style \| The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jan/28/my-gruelling-week-of-calling-gen-z-friends-rather-than-texting) #texting #calls #phones #genz 

> …those aged 18 to 34 – 61% of whom prefer a text to a call, and 23% of whom never bother answering, according to a [Uswitch survey](https://www.uswitch.com/media-centre/2024/04/Call-me-maybe-quarter-young-people-never-answer-phone/) last year. Such is the pervasiveness of phone call anxiety that a [college in Nottingham](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgm9klmzpjeo) recently launched coaching sessions for teenagers with “telephobia”, and a 2024 survey of 2,000 UK office workers found that [more than 40% of them had avoided answering a work call](https://ffb.co.uk/blog/phone-anxiety-in-business-are-fears-of-phone-calls-holding-businesses-back/) in the previous 12 months because of anxiety.

In this aspect I am more genz than millenial. I hate phone calls.

#### Algorithmic Ranking
[Algorithmic ranking is unfairly maligned](https://dynomight.substack.com/p/ranking)

> I theorize that the skeptics are right and algorithmic ranking is in fact bad. But it’s not algorithmic ranking _per se_ that’s bad—it’s just that the algorithms you’re used to don’t care about your goals. That might be an inevitable consequence of [“enshittification”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification), but the solution isn’t to avoid all algorithms, but just to avoid algorithms you can’t _control_. This will become increasingly important in the future as algorithmic ranking becomes algorithmic everything.
