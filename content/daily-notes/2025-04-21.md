#### AI Phobia
[AI Phobia Is Just Fear That ‘Easier’ Equals ‘Cheating’](https://every.to/working-overtime/ai-phobia-is-really-just-fear-that-easier-equals-cheating) #ai #phobia #skepticism

> Why do these businesses care so much? I suspect they aren’t really worried about AI—they're clinging to an old belief that if work isn't visibly difficult to produce, it must be less valuable. When we dig beneath the surface of "no-AI" policies and detection tools, we find an age-old assumption that worth must be measured in struggle. This mindset shows up again and again, from “hustle culture” and the “rise and grind’ mindset that defined the 2010s to recent return-to-office mandates that prioritize presence over performance. In a culture that values butts in seats and availability on Slack, it becomes easy to mistake friction for effort and effort for worth.

> Oddly enough, the very thing we’re resisting—the ease of AI—might be what sets us free. AI isn’t the first tool to challenge how we think about work, but it may be the most direct. By [shifting the locus of effort](https://every.to/learning-curve/the-future-of-work-isn-t-about-doing-less-it-s-about-doing-better), AI forces us to confront our dysfunctional relationship with work. It holds up a mirror to our culture’s deeply rooted belief that struggle equals value—and in that reflection lies a rare opportunity: to reimagine work in terms of outcomes, not optics; human flourishing, not performance theater.

> **Anne Helen Petersen** once memorably described this as ["LARPing your job"](https://annehelen.substack.com/p/larping-your-job)—performing a theatrical version of productivity. Workers engage in elaborate displays of "being at work": staying visible on Slack, responding to emails at all hours, and maintaining a digital presence that signals industriousness. The tools have evolved—from software that monitors keyboard activity to AI that analyzes facial expressions in video calls—but the underlying philosophy remains pure Taylorism.

> The irony is that these measurements often have little correlation with value creation. Knowledge work rarely follows linear patterns. Our most valuable contributions often come from reflection, seemingly "unproductive" conversations, exploration of dead ends, and invisible mental processing.

Slowly making my way through this. Found it via a tweet and this is a lot of signal for the relatively short length of the article. Really enjoying it!
