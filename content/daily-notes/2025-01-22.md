* LLMs are good at transforming text into less text
* LLMs only reliably know what you just told them, don't rely on training data
* LLMs cannot write for you
* Let them self-correct, multiple times if necessary
* Have the LLM do as little as possible
* LLMs can help a human perform tasks, they cannot replace a human
* LLMs are awesome and limited

> The soundtracks of Lynch’s movie and TV works also showcased existing songs, often mined from American popular music of past decades, and they clearly were not casual choices — one resonated so strongly with Lynch that he took it for a film’s title. Like [Kenneth Anger’s “Scorpio Rising,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6M08Czuqy80) which set transgressive biker imagery to 1960s pop, Lynch’s visual and musical juxtapositions could rearrange songs’ DNA, adding depth and new layers of meaning — just try hearing Roy Orbison’s “In Dreams” the same way after watching “Blue Velvet.”

#### Matt Levine on Crypto Memecoins
Matt Levine's latest newsletter which contains a section on the Trump Memecoin: [The SEC Was Busy Last Week - Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-01-21/the-sec-was-busy-last-week)

> Imagine you are elected mayor of a medium-sized city. Just before you take office, you announce a new program. This program is: You have set up a website where people can give you money. If they give you money, their name goes on a list, on your computer. “What do we get for the money,” they ask. “Oh nothing,” you say. “Your name just goes on the list, and I get the money, to spend. That’s it. Nothing happens with the list.”
> 
> You can, I think, see two fairly obvious problems here:
>
> 1. If you are telling the truth, people are giving you money for nothing, so why would they do it?
> 2. _Are_ you telling the truth? Will people believe you? Will people who want contracts with the city find it useful to be on the list? Isn’t this, you know?
> 
> It seems like this would be a scam, or a bribe, or probably both.

> Crypto [solves these problems](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-12-02/texas-asks-if-index-funds-are-illegal?sref=1kJVNqnU). Instead of a website with a list, you launch a memecoin with a ledger. People can give you money and get on the list, but in exchange they get something. The thing they get is: A _tradeable_ entry on the list, an electronic claim saying “I gave you money” that they can sell, at some fluctuating market price, to somebody else. They can _make money_ by giving you money: They give you $10 to get on the list, and then sell their spot on the list to someone else for $12.

So essentially, it's a legitimized form of bribery?
