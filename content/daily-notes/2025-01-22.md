[What I've learned about writing AI apps so far \| Seldo.com](https://seldo.com/posts/what-ive-learned-about-writing-ai-apps-so-far)

* LLMs are good at transforming text into less text
* LLMs only reliably know what you just told them, don't rely on training data
* LLMs cannot write for you
* Let them self-correct, multiple times if necessary
* Have the LLM do as little as possible
* LLMs can help a human perform tasks, they cannot replace a human
* LLMs are awesome and limited
