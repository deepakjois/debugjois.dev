#### The Perils of ‘The Perils of Design Thinking’
[The Perils of ‘Design Thinking’ - The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2025/06/invention-of-design-maggie-gram-book-review/683302/) #design #politics #culture 

> The concept of design, as the French philosopher Bruno Latour observed in a 2008 [lecture](https://sciencespo.hal.science/hal-00972919), has had an “extraordinary career.” No longer is design about making objects more beautiful and useful; instead, he suggested, “design is one of the terms that has replaced the word ‘revolution’!” That might be the problem. “Our contemporary idea of design,” Gram writes, is often used to convince ourselves “that positive social change could be achieved without politics and government action; that problem solving could be both generative and profitable.” But most ambitious changes on the societal level require political consensus, and [what’s profitable for some may not be beneficial for all](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/private-equity-firms-bankruptcies-plunder-book/673896/). Design may be a distraction from the real work.

#### In Praise of “Normal” Engineers

I really liked the part *How do you turn normal engineers into 10x engineering teams?*

1. Shrink the interval between when you write the code and when the code goes live.
2. Make it easy and fast to roll back or recover from mistakes.
3. Make it easy to do the right thing and hard to do the wrong thing.
4. Invest in instrumentation and observability.
5. Devote engineering cycles to internal tooling and enablement.
6. Build an inclusive culture.
7. Diverse teams are resilient teams.
8. Assemble engineering teams from a range of levels.
