#### The Perils of ‘The Perils of Design Thinking’

> The concept of design, as the French philosopher Bruno Latour observed in a 2008 [lecture](https://sciencespo.hal.science/hal-00972919), has had an “extraordinary career.” No longer is design about making objects more beautiful and useful; instead, he suggested, “design is one of the terms that has replaced the word ‘revolution’!” That might be the problem. “Our contemporary idea of design,” Gram writes, is often used to convince ourselves “that positive social change could be achieved without politics and government action; that problem solving could be both generative and profitable.” But most ambitious changes on the societal level require political consensus, and [what’s profitable for some may not be beneficial for all](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/private-equity-firms-bankruptcies-plunder-book/673896/). Design may be a distraction from the real work.

#### In Praise of “Normal” Engineers

I really liked the part *How do you turn normal engineers into 10x engineering teams?*

1. Shrink the interval between when you write the code and when the code goes live.
2. Make it easy and fast to roll back or recover from mistakes.
3. Make it easy to do the right thing and hard to do the wrong thing.
4. Invest in instrumentation and observability.
5. Devote engineering cycles to internal tooling and enablement.
6. Build an inclusive culture.
7. Diverse teams are resilient teams.
8. Assemble engineering teams from a range of levels.

#### Decentering work
[Is it finally time to decentre work?  \| Dazed](https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/68154/1/is-it-finally-time-to-decentre-work-hustle-culture-graduate-jobs) #work #hustle #capitalism 

> “The journey of emerging into adult responsible contexts [the working world] involves at some point the need to do some sort of deprogramming and unlearning as the fantasy of your working life becomes deconstructed by reality,” 25-year-old Olivia tells Dazed. Olivia graduated with her MA in 2023 and started working at her university shortly after, but she recently quit her job. Her last job made her acutely conscious of the structural violence of late-stage capitalism, and shaped her plans for the type of job she’d like to do next. “[It is important to look at] how you are being valued at a place where you swap your time, skills, mind and body for money,” she says. “And I use those words with _a lot_ of intention.”

> Framing work in the way that Olivia has is beneficial to understanding the oppressive nature of work under late-stage capitalism because you _are_ exchanging your limited time on earth and your health, [which can be seriously jeopardised by doing a desk job](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/office-job-risks-sitting-health-b2749608.html), for money. And this is, of course, not by choice. Helen Hester and Nick Srnicek argue in their book _After Work: A History of the Home and the Fight for Free Time,_ that “we are coerced into work on pain of homelessness, starvation and destitution.” In other words, we work because we have no other choice. This isn’t to say that work isn’t fulfilling and deeply enjoyable for some. It can provide a sense of purpose and optimism, especially when you’re doing something you love and feel passionate about. But the amount of time we’re expected to expend on our jobs (and lack of choice) can significantly sour that devotion.

> I would argue that young graduates’ dissatisfaction with work is potentially connected to the fact that their priorities differ from those of past generations. As older people were marrying young and [able to buy their homes and have children on their salaries](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20250603-housing-affordability-crisis-kyla-scanlon-katty-kay-interview), they were able to acquire symbols of the “good life”, as theorist Sara Ahmed describes it, even if it didn’t really make them happy. Gen Z (and millennials) struggle to receive the economic benefits that previous generations achieved through work, which potentially makes them less resilient to its brutality. It’s also important to note that the markers of the “good life” have [changed](https://www.shaziachiu.com/social-media-and-the-pressure-to-live-your-best-life/) in the social media age, where we are confronted 24/7 by influencers who are always on holiday, live in big homes and wear enviable clothing. They could not afford their lifestyle through a traditional nine-to-five job, and it makes one question the point of having one when you could just become a [content creator](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/14/more-than-half-of-gen-z-want-to-be-influencers-but-its-constant.html).

> As we’ve already established, under capitalism, everyone needs to work; and detailing the ways work under this system is coercive and detrimental to one’s health doesn’t change that fact, if anything, it’s just depressing. The intention of this article is not to depress anyone, but rather to prompt an examination of our feelings about work, as it often defines so much of our self-worth, creating fears about how others see and value us. You are not a failure if you can not find work in our incredibly fucked-up job market. You are more than the work you do and what you produce, and the same energy that goes into your working life should be expended on your personal life. Of course, our personal lives do not provide us with income, but they do equally (if not more so) provide us with the tools we need to stay alive: our friends, family and our communities (if we invest in them).
