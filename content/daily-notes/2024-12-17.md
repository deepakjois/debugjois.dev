#### Meditations with Mortals Day Twenty
This chapter is titled _Set a quantity goal: On firing your inner quality controller_. Not a whole lot of new insight for me tbh.

> A more pragmatic and imperfectionist way to ease up on a fixation with outcomes is to set a quantity goal. There’s no need to pretend you don’t care about the results of your work, or to eradicate the part of you that seeks control. Give that part something to do – just make sure it has nothing to do with the quality of the result. Eight hundred words per day; one hour on the side business every evening; five potential customers contacted; three pages of the material for the examination turned into flashcards (or the three-hour rule we encountered on Day Thirteen): these are goals anyone with the available time can achieve, so long as you’re willing to accept that, for now, quality isn’t the point.
