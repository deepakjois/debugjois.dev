#### Emotions vs Feelings
This is a good short YouTube video on distinguishing between feelings and emotions, and hence arriving at a more biological grounding for dealing with them. #feelings #emotions

I generated a summary of the transcript.

> **Theme Wise Breakdown**
> 
> **Misconceptions About Emotions**
> 
> Lisa Feldman Barrett opens by addressing common myths: that emotions are hardwired and universal, and that emotions are simply reactive impulses of an "animalistic" brain potentially overridden by rationality. These myths characterize emotions as something that happens to you, causing uncontrollable reactions, or as a sign of morality or mental illness.
> 
> **Redefining Emotions**
> 
> Barrett explains that emotions are actually brain-generated constructions. They arise because the brain continuously regulates the body’s internal states (such as glucose or oxygen levels) and uses past knowledge to predict and interpret these bodily signals in relation to the external world. This process produces the experiences we recognize as emotions.
> 
> **Difference Between Feelings and Emotions**
> 
> She clarifies that feelings—such as pleasantness, unpleasantness, calm, or activation—are features of emotions but are not equivalent to emotions themselves. Emotions are more complex episodes where the brain is effectively telling a story about bodily states influenced by past experience.
> 
> **Importance of This Understanding**
> 
> Barrett discusses how this perspective transforms the way we understand mental health conditions like depression, emphasizing that symptoms may arise from the brain’s metabolic regulation efforts rather than a straightforward pathology. This view invites a broader, more biologically grounded approach to treatment.
> 
> **Implications for Personal Change**
> 
> Since emotions are constructed using past experiences to make predictions, individuals are not prisoners of their past but architects of their emotional experience. Psychotherapy can reframe past experiences, and actively cultivating new experiences can alter brain predictions and future emotional responses. This empowers people to take control over their emotional lives by changing their present actions and experiences.
> 
> **Responsibility and Control Over Emotional Life**
> 
> Barrett notes that while early experiences shape the brain’s predictive models often without our control, adulthood brings the ability to choose and change experiences. These choices can reinforce or alter the brain’s emotional predictions, offering tools for healing and transformation despite life’s inherent unfairness.

#### Learning Electronics
[Electronic Nights I - Getting Started](https://mariozechner.at/posts/2024-07-25-electronic-nights-1/) ? #electronics 

Stumbled on this great guide to getting started with electronics which also traces the personal journey of the author from not being able to install a 9V battery or jumpstarting a car to building a electronic gadget.

#### James Baldwin quote
> “You think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world, but then you read. It was books that taught me that the things that tormented me most were the very things that connected me with all the people who were alive, who had ever been alive.”

I read this quote in a tweet today and realised that now more than ever in my past, I have truly internalized the message in the quote.
