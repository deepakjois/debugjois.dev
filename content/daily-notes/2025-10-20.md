#### Old and Young
> Everyone under 30 is prematurely old (worried about savings, career, FIRE).
> 
> Everyone over 50 is desperately young (Burning Man, psychedelics).
> 
> My theory: Information abundance aged the young by showing them all future problems all at once.
> 
> Information abundance also made the old young by showing them all missed experiences all at once.
> 
> So now Gen Z talks like retirement planners and boomers act like teenagers.
> 
> It's so over.

> The same analogy now applies to AI. Almost every business executive today is eager to tell investors about their AI strategy (even though 95 per cent of companies have not (yet) seen revenue gains) and every VC group is keen to show AI plays.
> 
> Similarly every Big Tech executive is investing in massive data centres, even though Bain reckons some $2tn of revenue will be needed to fund this by 2030. And charismatic figures like Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, keep promising fresh magic. Or as Stephan Eberle, a software engineer, laments: “Watching the industry’s behaviour around AI, I can’t shake this feeling that we’re all building bamboo aeroplanes [like cargo cults] and expecting them to fly.”
