#### Old and Young
> Everyone under 30 is prematurely old (worried about savings, career, FIRE).
> 
> Everyone over 50 is desperately young (Burning Man, psychedelics).
> 
> My theory: Information abundance aged the young by showing them all future problems all at once.
> 
> Information abundance also made the old young by showing them all missed experiences all at once.
> 
> So now Gen Z talks like retirement planners and boomers act like teenagers.
> 
> It's so over.
