#### A Complete Unknown
Finally got around to watching this and feeling pumped!

It occurred to me that Bob Dylan's iconic song *The Times They Are A-Changin'* might also be relevant to the current times.

#### The stay-at-home son
[The New Dream Job for Young Men: Stay-at-Home Son - WSJ](http://archive.today/jCJBo) #culture #genz #jobs 

> You’ve mocked them as mooches and mom’s basement dwellers. They prefer the term “stay-at-home sons,” and have a new hero in “Jeopardy” champion Brendan Liaw.

> This graduation season is likely to produce a whole lot of stay-at-home sons. The overall unemployment rate is 4.2%, but 8.2% of 20- to 24-year-olds are jobless. The unemployment rate for men in that age range is even worse, 9.6%.

#### On Rhyming and Poetry
[Rhyme, once in its prime, is in decline](https://www.economist.com/culture/2025/05/28/rhyme-once-in-its-prime-is-in-decline) #poetry #rhyme #literature 

> In the 20th century, many artforms became “more abstruse, inaccessible and difficult to appreciate”, says Steven Pinker, a professor at Harvard University, “possibly as a way of differentiating elites from the hoi polloi”. Any fool can enjoy an enjoyable thing, but only a committed intellectual can enjoy an unenjoyable one. By the mid-century, rhyming lines had fallen by half.
> 
> Modernist verse is thus the peacock’s tail of poetry: something that evolved to be clearly hard to bear, but impressive if you can. Consider the epigraph of T.S. Eliot’s [modernist masterpiece “The Waste Land”](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/09/15/the-waste-land-is-a-case-study-of-great-art-by-flawed-artists). It begins, forbiddingly, in Latin, then ends in ancient Greek with the words _apothanein thelo_ (“I want to die”). Eliot can make everyone feel a bit like that.

> Look at a list of recent winners of any of the big poetry prizes and most will share three characteristics: you will not have heard of them; their poems will not rhyme; and they will have worked as poets in universities, peddling poetry as (partially) state-subsidised muses. This is poetry less as a paid-for product than as a literary utility: something that—like road surfacing or sewage disposal—is widely considered necessary for a civilised society but that no one wants to fork out for.
> 
> The poetry that does sell is produced by a new generation of social-media poets such as Donna Ashworth and [Rupi Kaur](https://www.economist.com/prospero/2017/11/01/rupi-kaur-reinvents-poetry-for-the-social-media-generation). This is to the distress of intellectuals, for Instapoets’ verse is not the gas-works and cemetery kind. It is designed to be shared online, meaning that [it is anodyne](https://www.economist.com/britain/2024/01/15/britain-has-seen-an-alarming-rise-in-poetry-sales) and often accompanied by line drawings of birds.

#### Young Voters and Donald Trump
[How young voters helped to put Trump in the White House](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2025/05/27/how-young-voters-helped-to-put-trump-in-the-white-house) #elections #trump #genz #millenial 

Pretty detailed analysis of voting patterns of GenZ and millenial voters in 2024.

> THE 2024 election unfolded like a political thriller, replete with a last-minute candidate change, a cover-up, assassination attempts and ultimately the triumphant return of a convicted felon. But amid the spectacle, a quieter transformation took place. For the first time, millennials and [Gen Z](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/04/18/reasons-to-be-cheerful-about-generation-z), people born between 1981 and 2006, comprised a plurality of the electorate. Their drift towards [Donald Trump](https://www.economist.com/interactive/trump-approval-tracker) shaped the outcome.
> 
> Millennials and Gen Z are the most diverse and educated generations in American history, traits long thought to favour the Democratic Party. Yet a new report from Catalist, a left-leaning political-data firm, shows that although Democrats still won a majority of young voters, their long-standing advantage over the Republican Party was reduced by nearly two-thirds. In 2024 Kamala Harris’s margin of victory among these voters was 12 points smaller than was Joe Biden’s in 2020, a bigger swing than for any other cohort (see chart 1). The exodus was caused in large part by non-whites and helped propel Mr Trump back into the White House. But many of these voters lack firm partisan loyalties. They are still up for grabs.

> Research by Columbia University found that events in voters’ early adulthood have an outsize effect on their long-term partisanship. Older millennials aged into the electorate against the backdrop of the financial crisis and Occupy Wall Street. But for the youngest voters formative political events have been more diverse and disruptive. They have come of age during covid-19 lockdowns, cost-of-living shocks and the rise of and backlash against wokeness. How they will make ideological sense of the whiplash is difficult to predict.

#### AI and Job Loss
[Why AI hasn’t taken your job](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2025/05/26/why-ai-hasnt-taken-your-job) #ai #jobs #unemployment

> Returning to a measure we introduced in 2023, we examine American data on employment by occupation, singling out workers that are believed to be vulnerable to AI. These are white-collar employees, including people in back-office support, financial operations, sales and much more besides. There is a similar pattern here: we find no evidence of an AI hit (see chart 2). Quite the opposite, in fact. Over the past year the share of employment in white-collar work has risen very slightly.
> 
> Across the board, American unemployment remains low, at 4.2%. Wage growth is still reasonably strong, which is difficult to square with the notion that AI is causing demand for labour to fall. Trends outside America point in a similar direction. Earnings growth in much of the rich world, including Britain, the euro area and Japan, is strong. In 2024 the employment rate of the OECD club of rich countries, describing the share of working-age people who are actually in a job, hit an all-time high.
> 
> There are two competing explanations for these trends. The first is that, despite the endless announcements about how firms are ushering AI into their operations, few make much use of the technology for serious work. An official measure suggests that less than 10% of American companies employ it to produce goods and services. The second is that even when companies do adopt the tech, they do not let people go. AI may simply help workers do their jobs faster, rather than making them redundant. Whatever the explanation, for now there is no need to panic.

#### Ed Zitron on actually useful AI stuff
[The Better Offline Mailbag - Better Offline (podcast) \| Listen Notes](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/better-offline/the-better-offline-mailbag-zDIP1bjVAnE/#transcript) #ai #skepticism 

Below is a badly (AI) transcribed quote from Ed Zitron, the (in)famous AI skeptic from the Better Offline podcast answering a question about AI stuff he finds useful. There is a shoutout to [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/) and [Max Woolf](https://minimaxir.com/). 

> Question: A question from Garrett Smart. Do you think AI is actually useful and any capacity even as an assistant in the areas of art or programming?  
> 
> Ed Zitron: If so, why so? When it comes to art, I think that there are new functions like slightly better clone tools as well that I've heard people use. But really this is just a bridge from photoshop. I will say, for the most part, art is a not a great one because usually it's just getting rid of the creative side. Programming is a more complex ones. So there's an excellent video link to in the episode Notes from the Internet of Bucks that Carle Brown I think his name is. I really want him on the show, Carle if you're listening, please come on where he kind of said that generative AI code is different to what software engineering is. Like software engineering, he is solving a murder or an investigation far more than generative AI is just creating code, because software engineering isn't just spooting out code and saying here we go, we're done. We now have software. Software is a manifold series of different things you have to do, and on top of that, things break when you plug me into other things, and our internet and most software products are built in a patchwork of different things, so software development. The best I've heard is that it can be used in very controlled situations for very specific things. If you're really interested in learning what it can actually do. I recommend Max Wolf and Simon Wilson. I'll link them in the notes as well, but those two are no AI guys. I also really recommend the Internet Bugs, which again i'll link as well. There are software developers who use this stuff. I don't know about it, and actually the Internet of Bug videos really good as well, because it breaks the whole myth of oh Microsoft and Google saying twenty to thirty percent of their code is written by AI. It's kind of bullshit, as you'd expect, because you can't just hand off code like this. There's also vibe coding. Vibe coding in and of itself has so many problems in that. Yeah, when you create something that works in a way that you literally don't understand by definition, yeah, it's probably going to fucking break. I mean it will break at some point and you won't know how to fix it other than to poke the machine that build it and say, fix the problem. I don't understand.

I posted this for a time when folks who hate AI skeptics like Ed Zitron claim that these people are not capable of believing that AI can be useful in any form at all.

#### Sarah Miller's Ayahuasca Experience
[Pirates of the Ayahuasca \| Issue 50 \| n+1 \| Sarah Miller](https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-50/essays/pirates-of-the-ayahuasca/?ueid=7aaabf0d71933f976c55b0f4b1bd9f88) #psychedelics 

Honestly the article felt like a whole lot of nothing. That might be a tad unfair. Maybe there is something in it if one invests enough time and focus reading it.

My one and only ayahuasca experience was actually quite wonderful, and it did not have any of the drama around it, which constitutes the majority of the article. I came away confident in recommending psychedelics to most folks, as long as they were cautious and did enough research and introspection before taking the step.

#### The Rise of Substack
[Substack Has Changed in the Last 30 Days - by Ted Gioia](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/substack-has-changed-in-the-last)

This is a nice overview of how substack came to dominate the AI landscape.

1. **Stage 1**: People ignored Substack as it was small and unfamiliar, leading to blank stares when mentioned.
2. **Stage 2**: Substack became a target for mockery, treated as a joke by established media and perceived as a circus.
3. **Stage 3**: Powerful figures began attacking Substack for its independence, but these efforts ultimately backfired and fueled its growth.
4. **Stage 4**: The establishment is now rushing to join Substack, marking a significant shift in perception and acceptance of the platform.

#### Male Loneliness
[Where Have All My Deep Male Friendships Gone?](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/25/magazine/male-friendships.html)

Yet another article in what it seems like a deluge of articles about male loneliness. But this one is worth read. I skimmed it and was a bit lazy to extract quotes though, except this one which looked interesting but isnt directly related to the subject matter

> There was a particular episode that I devoured with rapt fascination. The guest was a man named David Goggins. He was hawking his book “Can’t Hurt Me,” a harrowing saga of being brutally beaten by his father when he was a child, getting called the N-word at his predominantly white high school in small-town Indiana, drowning his sorrows in doughnuts and eventually becoming a depressed 300-pound man. But then, after a particularly bad night at his job killing cockroaches, he comes home, sees a TV show about the Navy SEALs and soon after decides to lose 100 pounds in three months so he can qualify for active service and try out for the SEALs. Not only does he shed the weight in that preposterously tiny window of time, he then survives the SEALs’ infamous “Hell Week,” enduring an unrelenting barrage of excruciating physical trials bordering on torture (and which have led to several actual deaths) _despite_ his injuries and congenital health issues. He becomes a SEAL, and after serving in Iraq, quickly transforms himself into one of the world’s premiere ultramarathoners, completing more than 70 endurance races, many of them in excess of 100 miles.
> 
> Goggins — who, in the wake of that “Rogan” appearance, became a mega-best-selling author with nearly 13 million Instagram followers — professes to absolutely despise running. And yet he laces up his shoes and hits the road every day, _because_ he hates it. This is his message: Deliberately suffer. Do something you hate to do, every single day, no matter what. If you feel like a victim, victimize your own body. Callous the mind, keep going and stay hard.

#### Cure for Individualism
[What is the cure for the West’s individualist worldview? \| Aeon Essays](https://aeon.co/essays/what-is-the-cure-for-the-wests-individualist-worldview) #individualism #western #philosophy #confucianism

> Yet even people living in individualist societies can recognise that the worldview leads to problems when taken to its extreme. At the broadest level, it encourages a mindset of seeing others either as competitors or as means to our own satisfaction. In politics, it undercuts attempts at social justice or building safer and healthier communities, holding that any restriction on individual rights is either ‘communism’ or ‘fascism’. A number of our books begin with a litany of global problems that the individualist worldview seems powerless to solve: climate change, wealth inequality, political polarisation. While individualism encourages an ethic of personal responsibility in relation to our own choices and actions, it doesn’t ask much of us in connection to issues that we did not directly cause.

> The Confucian alternative begins from a notion of what contemporary scholars call the ‘relational self’ – that a person cannot be understood in isolation from their connections with those around them. What is most relevant about me is not that I am a free and autonomous agent, but rather that I am so-and-so’s son or daughter, grandchild or sibling; someone’s teacher, colleague or mentor; a member of such-and-such neighbourhood and community. In its conception of the person as inseparable from their relationships, the role-bearing self poses a challenge to the social contract view of humans as pristine individuals who participate in society only voluntarily.

> If it is impossible for people living in modern, Western societies to ever get rid of individualism in its entirety, the only cure is to develop more balanced and humane forms of individualism. If we see hyper-individualism as a problem, then studying traditions such as Confucianism can help us keep in view the broader range of things that ought to matter in a good human life. For those forms of individualism that we find worthy of our allegiance and protection, the Confucian relational perspective can deepen our perspective on what it means to be an individual among others, along with a set of daily practices that can aid in our self-realisation.

> The ideal of interconnectedness is not limited to Chinese or East Asian philosophy. It is also found in Western political philosophers such as Aristotle; in contemporary communitarians and virtue ethicists; and in versions of care ethics that have been developed by feminist thinkers. Cross-cultural philosophers have used concepts from other non-Western traditions – such as _ubuntu_ from [African philosophy](https://aeon.co/essays/consolation-philosophy-and-the-struggle-of-reason-in-africa), or the [no-self from Buddhism](https://aeon.co/essays/the-logic-of-buddhist-philosophy-goes-beyond-simple-truth) – to launch similar challenges to the predominance of individualism in modern life. Seen in the context of these other traditions both inside and outside of Western philosophy, individualism appears as less of an inevitability.
> 
> Since individualist philosophy is so deeply embedded in the cultures of much of North America and Europe, the study of non-Western traditions can be helpful in providing an alternative vision of the good life. One thing that crosscultural philosophy teaches us is that stepping back from our cultural norms is often far more difficult than we think. Even when they attempt to provide alternatives to individualism, philosophers working exclusively in Western traditions can remain mired in individualist assumptions. Philosophical traditions from Asia and Africa give us fully worked-out conceptual schemes that have developed in relative isolation from the Western individualist ethos. These traditions can help us figure out what we might be missing in modern societies, while at the same time showing us some of the things that we may have gotten right. In developing a better version of ourselves, we need all the help we can get.

#### The Experience of Being Single
[Is being single a happier experience for women or men? \| Psyche Ideas](https://psyche.co/ideas/is-being-single-a-happier-experience-for-women-or-men) #gender #relationships #love

>One potential reason why single women might tend to experience a happier singlehood has to do with their social support system, including their friends and family. It’s well established that strong social [ties](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2006-01813-047) are an important factor in happiness, and they even seem to be one protective factor against an early death. Single people are no exception to the reality that social connections are a valuable part of a full life; singles often [report](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0265407515597564) that their relationships with friends, family, neighbours and acquaintances are important to their happiness.


> Women having a better time in singlehood might also reflect that, for many of them, being single seems preferable to the alternative. One [perspective](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8382213/) advanced by sexuality researchers proposes that women in heterosexual relationships are often expected to take on most of the household work and management in a way that leaves them feeling more like ‘mothers’ than lovers to their romantic partners. Add to this that women’s sexual [pleasure](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17456916211041598) often comes second (at best), and you can start to see why some women feel like relationships are a net loss.
> 
> The bargain might have seemed more worthwhile to some of these women in a time when men dominated the workplace, so that a relationship was the most viable path to having money in the bank. But as women have continued to make strides in the workplace and many societies have gradually moved toward greater pay equity, more women may be choosing ‘no deal’ when it comes to having a spouse. It could be that many of the single women we surveyed see singlehood as a space where there is less work, less hassle and more room for a life that addresses their needs.

> If our data are telling us that this happy story applies more to women than men, on average, what can single men take away from it? In light of the growing concern about male loneliness, perhaps men can learn from women’s approach to singlehood. While social norms around masculinity might encourage them to focus more of their time and energy on pursuing financial success and climbing the career ladder, men, and particularly single men, may need to make sure they are directing enough attention towards building and maintaining social connections and taking care of themselves. This might include things like initiating more coffee chats or other hangouts to catch up with friends, or speaking with a therapist to work on their mental health. For single men who want to partner up eventually, a stronger social circle might have the benefit of making them more attractive to potential partners. But more importantly, it might bring men greater joy in singlehood as well.

#### Research Behind Bloomberg Travel Guides

This is a great in-depth look into how Bloomberg produces its two-night guides for cities around the world as part of its travel section. If not anything, this makes me take their guides more seriously next time I am doing my travel research.

And this photograph appealed to the notetaker in me
