It occurred to me that Bob Dylan's iconic song *The Times They Are A-Changin'* might also be relevant to the current times.

> You’ve mocked them as mooches and mom’s basement dwellers. They prefer the term “stay-at-home sons,” and have a new hero in “Jeopardy” champion Brendan Liaw.

> This graduation season is likely to produce a whole lot of stay-at-home sons. The overall unemployment rate is 4.2%, but 8.2% of 20- to 24-year-olds are jobless. The unemployment rate for men in that age range is even worse, 9.6%.

#### On Rhyming and Poetry
[Rhyme, once in its prime, is in decline](https://www.economist.com/culture/2025/05/28/rhyme-once-in-its-prime-is-in-decline) #poetry #rhyme #literature 

> In the 20th century, many artforms became “more abstruse, inaccessible and difficult to appreciate”, says Steven Pinker, a professor at Harvard University, “possibly as a way of differentiating elites from the hoi polloi”. Any fool can enjoy an enjoyable thing, but only a committed intellectual can enjoy an unenjoyable one. By the mid-century, rhyming lines had fallen by half.

> Modernist verse is thus the peacock’s tail of poetry: something that evolved to be clearly hard to bear, but impressive if you can. Consider the epigraph of T.S. Eliot’s [modernist masterpiece “The Waste Land”](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/09/15/the-waste-land-is-a-case-study-of-great-art-by-flawed-artists). It begins, forbiddingly, in Latin, then ends in ancient Greek with the words _apothanein thelo_ (“I want to die”). Eliot can make everyone feel a bit like that.

> Look at a list of recent winners of any of the big poetry prizes and most will share three characteristics: you will not have heard of them; their poems will not rhyme; and they will have worked as poets in universities, peddling poetry as (partially) state-subsidised muses. This is poetry less as a paid-for product than as a literary utility: something that—like road surfacing or sewage disposal—is widely considered necessary for a civilised society but that no one wants to fork out for.

> The poetry that does sell is produced by a new generation of social-media poets such as Donna Ashworth and [Rupi Kaur](https://www.economist.com/prospero/2017/11/01/rupi-kaur-reinvents-poetry-for-the-social-media-generation). This is to the distress of intellectuals, for Instapoets’ verse is not the gas-works and cemetery kind. It is designed to be shared online, meaning that [it is anodyne](https://www.economist.com/britain/2024/01/15/britain-has-seen-an-alarming-rise-in-poetry-sales) and often accompanied by line drawings of birds.
