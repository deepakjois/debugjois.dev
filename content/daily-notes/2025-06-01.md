#### A Complete Unknown
Finally got around to watching this and feeling pumped!

It occurred to me that Bob Dylan's iconic song *The Times They Are A-Changin'* might also be relevant to the current times.

#### The stay-at-home son

> You’ve mocked them as mooches and mom’s basement dwellers. They prefer the term “stay-at-home sons,” and have a new hero in “Jeopardy” champion Brendan Liaw.

> This graduation season is likely to produce a whole lot of stay-at-home sons. The overall unemployment rate is 4.2%, but 8.2% of 20- to 24-year-olds are jobless. The unemployment rate for men in that age range is even worse, 9.6%.

#### On Rhyming and Poetry
[Rhyme, once in its prime, is in decline](https://www.economist.com/culture/2025/05/28/rhyme-once-in-its-prime-is-in-decline) #poetry #rhyme #literature 

> In the 20th century, many artforms became “more abstruse, inaccessible and difficult to appreciate”, says Steven Pinker, a professor at Harvard University, “possibly as a way of differentiating elites from the hoi polloi”. Any fool can enjoy an enjoyable thing, but only a committed intellectual can enjoy an unenjoyable one. By the mid-century, rhyming lines had fallen by half.
> 
> Modernist verse is thus the peacock’s tail of poetry: something that evolved to be clearly hard to bear, but impressive if you can. Consider the epigraph of T.S. Eliot’s [modernist masterpiece “The Waste Land”](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/09/15/the-waste-land-is-a-case-study-of-great-art-by-flawed-artists). It begins, forbiddingly, in Latin, then ends in ancient Greek with the words _apothanein thelo_ (“I want to die”). Eliot can make everyone feel a bit like that.

> Look at a list of recent winners of any of the big poetry prizes and most will share three characteristics: you will not have heard of them; their poems will not rhyme; and they will have worked as poets in universities, peddling poetry as (partially) state-subsidised muses. This is poetry less as a paid-for product than as a literary utility: something that—like road surfacing or sewage disposal—is widely considered necessary for a civilised society but that no one wants to fork out for.
> 
> The poetry that does sell is produced by a new generation of social-media poets such as Donna Ashworth and [Rupi Kaur](https://www.economist.com/prospero/2017/11/01/rupi-kaur-reinvents-poetry-for-the-social-media-generation). This is to the distress of intellectuals, for Instapoets’ verse is not the gas-works and cemetery kind. It is designed to be shared online, meaning that [it is anodyne](https://www.economist.com/britain/2024/01/15/britain-has-seen-an-alarming-rise-in-poetry-sales) and often accompanied by line drawings of birds.

#### Young Voters and Donald Trump
[How young voters helped to put Trump in the White House](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2025/05/27/how-young-voters-helped-to-put-trump-in-the-white-house) #elections #trump #genz #millenial 

Pretty detailed analysis of voting patterns of GenZ and millenial voters in 2024.

> THE 2024 election unfolded like a political thriller, replete with a last-minute candidate change, a cover-up, assassination attempts and ultimately the triumphant return of a convicted felon. But amid the spectacle, a quieter transformation took place. For the first time, millennials and [Gen Z](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/04/18/reasons-to-be-cheerful-about-generation-z), people born between 1981 and 2006, comprised a plurality of the electorate. Their drift towards [Donald Trump](https://www.economist.com/interactive/trump-approval-tracker) shaped the outcome.
> 
> Millennials and Gen Z are the most diverse and educated generations in American history, traits long thought to favour the Democratic Party. Yet a new report from Catalist, a left-leaning political-data firm, shows that although Democrats still won a majority of young voters, their long-standing advantage over the Republican Party was reduced by nearly two-thirds. In 2024 Kamala Harris’s margin of victory among these voters was 12 points smaller than was Joe Biden’s in 2020, a bigger swing than for any other cohort (see chart 1). The exodus was caused in large part by non-whites and helped propel Mr Trump back into the White House. But many of these voters lack firm partisan loyalties. They are still up for grabs.

> Research by Columbia University found that events in voters’ early adulthood have an outsize effect on their long-term partisanship. Older millennials aged into the electorate against the backdrop of the financial crisis and Occupy Wall Street. But for the youngest voters formative political events have been more diverse and disruptive. They have come of age during covid-19 lockdowns, cost-of-living shocks and the rise of and backlash against wokeness. How they will make ideological sense of the whiplash is difficult to predict.
