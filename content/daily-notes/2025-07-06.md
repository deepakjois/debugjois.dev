#### AI, ML and Deep Learning

> I was working my way through this article when I came across a nice, simple definition of the different categories - AI, ML and Deep Learning
> 
> AI is fundamentally about creating computer systems capable of performing tasks that usually require human intelligence. These tasks include understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, and making decisions. (Despite significant progress, AI is still far from achieving this level of general intelligence.)
> 
> _Machine learning_ represents a subfield of AI (as illustrated in Figure 2) that focuses on developing and improving learning algorithms. The key idea behind machine learning is to enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task. This involves developing algorithms that can identify patterns and learn from historical data and improve their performance over time with more data and feedback.
> 
> Machine learning has been integral in the evolution of AI, powering many of the advancements we see today, including LLMs. Machine learning is also behind technologies like recommendation systems used by online retailers and streaming services, email spam filtering, voice recognition in virtual assistants, and even self-driving cars. The introduction and advancement of machine learning have significantly enhanced AI’s capabilities, enabling it to move beyond strict rule-based systems and adapt to new inputs or changing environments.
> 
> _Deep learning_ is a subcategory of machine learning that focuses on the training and application of deep neural networks. These deep neural networks were originally inspired by how the human brain works, particularly the interconnection between many neurons. The “deep” in deep learning refers to the multiple hidden layers of artificial neurons or nodes that allow them to model complex, nonlinear relationships in the data.
> 
> Unlike traditional machine learning techniques that excel at simple pattern recognition, deep learning is particularly good at handling unstructured data like images, audio, or text, so deep learning is particularly well suited for LLMs.

#### Oliver Burkeman on Insecure Overachievers
[The Imperfectionist: Acting because you don't have to](https://ckarchive.com/b/d0ueh0ho7966vbk4xx64otzpvrq44clhn540k)

> The spiritual teacher Michael Singer says somewhere that the basic stance most of us take toward the world is that **we try to use life to make ourselves feel OK.** And this is certainly true of the type psychologists label [‘insecure overachievers’](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20180924-are-you-an-insecure-overachiever), who often accomplish plenty of impressive things, but who do so, deep down, because we don’t believe we’d have earned the right to feel good about ourselves, or to relax into life, if we didn’t.
> 
> It’s a soul-crushing way to live, not least because it turns each success into a new source of oppression, since now that’s the minimum standard you feel obliged to meet next time…
> 
> Most productivity advice, I think, caters to people mired in this mindset. It promises ways to help you take so much action, so efficiently, that you might one day get to feel good about yourself at last. Which isn’t going to work – because the real problem isn’t that you haven’t yet done enough things, or got good enough at doing them. The real problem is the fact that for whatever combination of reasons in your childhood, culture or genes, your sense of self-worth and psychological safety got tethered to your productivity or accomplishments in the first place.

This is a really good take on ambition, and continuing to be ambitious without being constantly in insecure-overachiever mode

> One of the most important consequences of all this, for me, has been the realisation that when you begin to outgrow action-from-insecurity, **you don’t have to give up on being ambitious.** On the contrary: you get to be much more effectively and enjoyably ambitious, if that’s the way you’re inclined.
> 
> I’ve long been allergic to the notion, prevalent in self-help circles, that if you truly managed to liberate yourself from your issues, you’d ideally spend your days just sort of passively floating around, smiling at everyone, maybe attending the occasional yoga retreat, but not much more. [“The more I heal, the less ambitious I become”](https://www.newsweek.com/millennial-woman-eye-opening-realization-ambition-2040553) is a phrase I’ve encountered multiple times online in recent months. And yes, sure, if your ambition was only ever a function of anxiety, becoming less ambitious would be an excellent development. Then again, the desire to create remarkable outcomes in your creative work, relationships or community – or even just in your bank balance – might just be an authentic part of who you are, once the clouds of insecurity begin to clear.

> So you don’t need to choose between peace of mind and the thrill of pursuing ambitious goals. You just need to understand those goals less as vehicles to get you to a future place of sanity and good feeling, and more as things that unfold _from_ an existing place of sanity and good feeling. (Besides, I’ve got to believe that ambition pursued in this spirit is far likelier to make a positive difference in the world.)
