> By lending “slop” the legitimacy of the _New York Times_, we would instantly be elevating it against potential synonyms, giving it more of a platform to spread than its competitors. Alternatively, we could kill the word by making it seem unnatural, like Taylor Lorenz likely did with her [2021 article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/29/style/cheugy.html) about the then-nascent word “cheugy.” I called this the _Linguistic Observer Effect_: by publicly observing a word, we inadvertently alter its trajectory.

Two Fundamental Psychological Systems:

- **Peer Instinct**: Humans are uniquely attuned to peer behaviors, conforming to group norms to gain acceptance and avoid isolation. This creates social codes.
- **Hero Instinct**: People look up to high-status individuals as models of admired behavior, which promotes status-seeking through valued community contributions.

Tribalism in the Digital Age:
- **Epistemic Tribalism**: In a fragmented media landscape, people form echo chambers, valuing in-group cohesion over objective truth.
