Great video on how subjective coffee tasting is, and how you may not be crazy for not liking that expensive packet of beans.

#### Garbage
[Garbage — Ridgeline issue 203](https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/203/)

Craig Mod has a great piece on social norms around garbage in Japan. Most Japanese public spaces don't have a lot of garbage bins and you are supposed to carry your own garbage.

> The first time I walked into a random shop in Tokyo and asked to throw away something (a Starbucks cup, perhaps? an item I did not buy from the shop itself) was twenty-five years ago. The owner looked at me like I had just asked him if I could jump on his desk and take a shit. I’ve never bothered a shop with my garbage since.

…

> In Kamakura, Starbucks has big signs instructing non-Japanese customers to please not leave their take-away cups in random locations. (Apparently this was becoming endemic.) There are no garbage cans in Kamakura, and, indeed, if you are buying a coffee to go, you will be responsible for that receptacle for, potentially, a very long time. This is your grandé-sized hair shirt to bear.

…

> This obsession with the immediate “unburdening” of a thing _you_ created is common in non-Japanese contexts, but I posit: The Japanese way is the correct way. Be an adult. Own your garbage. Garbage responsibility is something we’ve long since abdicated not only to faceless cans on street corners (or just all over the street, as seems to be the case in Manhattan or Paris), but also faceless developing countries around the world. Our oceans teem with the waste from generations of averted eyes. And I believe the two — local pathologies and attendant global pathologies — are _not_ not connected.

…

> Personally, I don’t _love_ carrying my garbage around with me, but I recognize that it wouldn’t exist without my intervention. Nobody ran up and asked me to hold an empty cup. I thoughtlessly bought something. Thoughtlessly consumed it, and now I have to hold onto the detritus for a little while? Great. It’s easy. Easy to embrace that modicum of responsibility for your own waste. This is my protest song, the world’s lamest: I will attend to my garbage without complaint. Maybe give it a try next time you’re in Japan? It’s very exciting — to realize you will not be killed by your garbage, that holding a Snickers’ wrapper will not drain your crypto reserves, that not having piles of everyone else’s garbage all around is quite a nice bonus when walking through a city. And it might just keep you from buying unnecessary junk.

#### Ideological Propaganda by Way of the Algorithm

> In their 1947 _Dialectic of Enlightenment_, the philosophers Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer [voiced their concerns](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/adorno/1944/culture-industry.htm) about how the popular media of the time_—_film, radio, and magazines_—_primarily functioned to pacify the general population.
>
> To them, the “culture industry” was a tool to both occupy our senses and influence our attitudes toward the world. Through the mass production of entertainment, the media-makers are able to dominate people’s leisure “from the time they leave the factory in the evening to the time they clock in again the next morning.” The flat, repetitive nature of the content, meanwhile, enforces social structures by pushing the same conformist narratives, and the movie-goer never questions anything since he “sees the world outside as an extension of the film he has just left.”

> Adorno and Horkheimer would probably be losing their shit today.
