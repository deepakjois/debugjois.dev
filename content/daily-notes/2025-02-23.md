Great video on how subjective coffee tasting is, and how you may not be crazy for not liking that expensive packet of beans.

#### Garbage
[Garbage — Ridgeline issue 203](https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/203/)

Craig Mod has a great piece on social norms around garbage in Japan. Most Japanese public spaces don't have a lot of garbage bins and you are supposed to carry your own garbage.

> The first time I walked into a random shop in Tokyo and asked to throw away something (a Starbucks cup, perhaps? an item I did not buy from the shop itself) was twenty-five years ago. The owner looked at me like I had just asked him if I could jump on his desk and take a shit. I’ve never bothered a shop with my garbage since.

…

> In Kamakura, Starbucks has big signs instructing non-Japanese customers to please not leave their take-away cups in random locations. (Apparently this was becoming endemic.) There are no garbage cans in Kamakura, and, indeed, if you are buying a coffee to go, you will be responsible for that receptacle for, potentially, a very long time. This is your grandé-sized hair shirt to bear.

…

This obsession with the immediate “unburdening” of a thing _you_ created is common in non-Japanese contexts, but I posit: The Japanese way is the correct way. Be an adult. Own your garbage. Garbage responsibility is something we’ve long since abdicated not only to faceless cans on street corners (or just all over the street, as seems to be the case in Manhattan or Paris), but also faceless developing countries around the world. Our oceans teem with the waste from generations of averted eyes. And I believe the two — local pathologies and attendant global pathologies — are _not_ not connected.

The modern condition consists of a constant self-infantilization, of any number of “non-adulting” activities. The main being, of course, plugging into a dopamine casino right before going to sleep and right upon waking up. At least a morning cigarette habit in 1976 gave one time to look at the world in front of one’s eyes (and a gentle nicotine buzz). Other non-adulting activities include relinquishment of general attention, concentration, and critical thinking capabilities. The desire for _deus ex machina_ style political intercession that belies the complexities of real-world systems. Easy answers, easy solutions to problems of unfathomable scale. Scientific retardation because it “feels” good. Deliverance — _deliverance!_ — now, with as little effort as possible.
