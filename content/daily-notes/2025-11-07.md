#### AI as leverage
[What’s really going on with AI and jobs?](https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/what-the-hell-is-going-on-with-ai) #jobs #ai

> As readers of BITM will know, [much of the job loss from AI has thus far](https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/the-ai-jobs-crisis-is-here-now) seems to have unfolded in cases like this, where “AI” is deployed not so much as a technology functionally capable of replacing human labor in toto, but as a logic and an ideological justification for management’s ulterior goals. Where management wants to cut labor costs a la Amazon, shift to cheaper contract labor [a la Klarna](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/firing-700-humans-ai-klarna-173029838.html), or execute layoffs for ideological reasons, a la DOGE, “AI” is an extremely potent justification. Some business professors and analysts have taken to [calling this practice](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/04/white-collar-layoffs-ai-cost-cutting-tariffs.html) “AI-washing.” If Amazon is firing 30,000 workers because its technology is so cutting edge that its AI systems can ably replace them, investors will be a lot happier than if Amazon is cutting costs because, say, it’s over-leveraging itself on data center expansion or its worried about earnings.

> In short, it’s still pretty hard to say whether these kinds of job losses will be permanent, whether firms will have to rehire the workers it shed if and when the AI tools management is touting don’t pan out, and so on. After all, it’s only been a couple months since a major MIT report found that [95% of companies](https://mlq.ai/media/quarterly_decks/v0.1_State_of_AI_in_Business_2025_Report.pdf) that invested in generative AI did not profit at all from the investment. (The paper found that enterprise grade AI systems “fail due to brittle workflows, lack of contextual learning, and misalignment with day-to-day operations.”) What _is_ clear is that AI is regardless a powerful way for bosses to exert leverage over workers, depress wages, and effect layoffs.


> This, as BITM readers might notice, _generally_ aligns with my read of what’s happening as well. As the MIT study and Chiu’s work both highlight, generative AI is not reliable enough when it comes executing complex tasks to enable most organizations to displace jobs at scale, and it certainly can’t do jobs that require empathy or hands-on problem-solving. What it _can_ do is automate the production of work that need not be “reliable” or “accurate,” but that employers might find “good enough.” Precisely the way many corporate executives already conceive of creative work, in other words. And it can inspire overzealous executives, or managers who wanted to induce layoffs or cost-cutting anyway, to pull the trigger.
> 
> In sum, and not to just end here having confirmed my priors, the answer to the lead-off question “what the hell is happening with AI and jobs?” is the deeply unsatisfactory “management is using it in various ways, both as a buzzy ideological framework and an actual automation technology, to achieve various ends, including but far from limited to job replacement.”

#### Shanghai's Coffee Culture
[Why Shanghai Is the World’s Most Compelling Coffee City Right Now - Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/why-shanghai-is-the-world-s-most-compelling-coffee-city-right-now?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MjUxMTUzMSwiZXhwIjoxNzYzMTE2MzMxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNExWNTdHUEwzV1QwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiI5QTg2QjY3RUZGOUE0OTA4OThBNjY4ODIwNTZGMDNFQiJ9.ZkSU0eFLz9fIoqfSkdzKqRfQw5N6EcAmFd38eJkf-X0) #china 

> But on a recent trip to Shanghai, I experienced an even greater surprise: a world class coffee scene. My jet lag never stood a chance in the face of the caffeine tsunami I stepped into. As of 2024 the city had a whopping 9,115 coffee shops—including more [Starbucks](https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/SBUX:US) locations than any other city—as reported by [Dao Insights](https://daoinsights.com/), a publication by the China-focused digital creative agency Qumin.

> But Shanghai’s coffee scene isn’t just defined by quantity; it courses with style, creativity and quality. Coffee here is presented both seriously—[George Jinyang Peng](https://www.instagram.com/georgew.peng/), owner of the Captain George Flavor Museum coffee shop, just won the World Brewers Cup championship—and as a vehicle for eccentric but photogenic flights of fancy.

> When I asked co-founder Sualeh Asif what he’s most concerned about when it comes to company-building, he responded, “People start talking about the weather at meals.” I haven’t seen any evidence he has much to worry about.

> Cursor interviews are known to be very difficult for candidates, particularly the coding challenges. When I asked the team about this, they insisted that “it’s hard to show off how good you are on something too easy,” and that they were “willing to accept false negatives to avoid false positives.”

This trope about accepting false negatives exists since the dawn of tech interviewing, so I feel a bit sad to see it here again.

All in all, it's reads a bit like a propaganda piece tbh.
