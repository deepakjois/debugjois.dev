Been rewatching Andor S1 since I tweeted about it a couple of days ago.

#### Tokyo
Lots of Indians are going to Tokyo, and I keep seeing pics on X. But they also seem to be doing the same stereotypical things, that I did back when I was there several years ago.

This NYT article about visiting Tokyo has a slightly offbeat 3-day itinerary: [36 Hours in Tokyo: Things to Do and See - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/04/06/travel/things-to-do-tokyo.html) #tokyo #japan #travel #offbeat

#### Jung Quote

> "People will do anything, no matter how absurd, in order to avoid facing their own souls. They will practice Indian yoga and all its exercises, observe a strict regimen of diet, learn theosophy by heart, or mechanically repeat mystic texts from the literature of the whole world – all because they cannot get on with themselves and have not the slightest faith that anything useful could ever come out of their own souls."

#### The Bro Vote
I read about this in the Vox Culture newsletter from Rebecca Jennings. The newsletter doesn't seem to be accessible online, but there is a members exclusive article which covers the same thing: [From Joe Rogan to Theo Von, Gen Z podcasts and livestreams helped Trump win | Vox](https://www.vox.com/culture/383364/gen-z-podcasts-trump-win-joe-rogan-bros) #trump 

> Could it be that growing up in a fundamentally different media environment than generations before them, one populated by individual influencers who often preach the values of entrepreneurship, self-improvement, and, ultimately, self-interest over everything else, galvanized the youngest voters to vote for a man who shared that same spirit? Or could it be that young men have helped make this content popular because they like what it says?

> What’s clear is that Donald Trump catered to the bro vote and won.

#### Male Loneliness
The article above about The Bro Vote triggered a journey down the rabbit hole of male loneliness. 

My starting points were two articles I had come across in Sept from Alice Evans (and linked in the daily log as well), which I re-read:

- [Automation, Ageing & Men's Loss of Status - by Alice Evans](https://www.ggd.world/p/automation-ageing-and-mens-loss-of)
- [Ghosting the Patriarchy: Female Empowerment and the Crisis of Masculinity](https://www.ggd.world/p/ghosting-the-patriarchy-female-empowerment)

Found this report titled _State of American Men 2023_ from one of Alice Evans' [other articles](https://www.ggd.world/p/why-is-fertility-collapsing-globally) (which is only tangential related). PDF here (the executive summary is great): [STATE-OF-AMERICAN-MEN-2023.pdf](https://www.equimundo.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/STATE-OF-AMERICAN-MEN-2023.pdf)

Read a few more articles but came away a bit unsatisfied. Decided to ask ChatGPT to give me a succinct breakdown, and I thought it did a pretty good job.

> Male loneliness has increased in recent times due to shifting societal norms, changing labor markets, and evolving relationship dynamics. Traditional forms of male bonding, such as workplace camaraderie and community-based activities, have diminished with the rise of remote work and urbanization. These changes have led to fewer opportunities for men to form and maintain deep friendships. Research by Niobe Way, author of _Deep Secrets: Boys’ Friendships and the Crisis of Connection_, highlights how boys are often socialized out of forming close emotional bonds as they age, leading to a lack of intimate friendships in adulthood. This socialization, combined with modern lifestyles that prioritize individualism over community, exacerbates male loneliness.
> 
> Additionally, the decline in marriage rates and delays in forming long-term relationships play a significant role. Sociologist Eric Klinenberg's work in _Going Solo_ reveals how the increasing prevalence of single-person households—particularly among men—contributes to feelings of isolation. Digital dating culture, while ostensibly expanding opportunities to connect, often fails to provide the deep, meaningful relationships men seek. This is compounded by the fact that men are less likely than women to maintain social networks outside of romantic relationships, leaving them more vulnerable to loneliness when those connections are absent or fail.
> 
> Finally, mental health stigmas continue to inhibit men from seeking help or sharing their struggles. The societal expectation for men to embody self-reliance and emotional stoicism discourages them from building supportive networks. Studies such as those by Brené Brown on vulnerability show that the inability to express emotions openly hampers relational depth. These combined factors underscore how recent societal shifts have uniquely affected men, leading to increased loneliness and a pressing need for cultural and structural solutions.

#### Kyla Scanlon on How Trump Won
[How Trump Won, What Happens Next, and How Disconnects Drove Democracy](https://kyla.substack.com/p/how-trump-won-what-happens-next-and)

Kyla is already great at taking disparate narratives and summarizing them. So I am not going to attempt to quote from her piece. Just go read the whole thing, it's great!

The majority of the article is focused on economic and policy analysis, but even she refers to the idea of Trump winning over young male voters, by linking out to this Bloomberg article: [Trump’s Appeal to Young Men in Three Charts: Election 2024 - Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-11-07/trump-s-appeal-to-young-men-in-three-charts-election-2024)

#### More Trump and Election Analysis
Just gonna collect the random links under one heading:

- [Donald Trump won the vibes. Now America's anti-democratic coalition seeks vengeance   | Salon.com](https://www.salon.com/2024/11/06/donald-won-the-vibes-now-americas-anti-democratic-coalition-seeks-vengeance/)
- [Five Reasons Why Trump Won Again – SAPIENS](https://www.sapiens.org/culture/why-many-americans-voted-for-trump-again/)
- [The changes in vibes - why did they happen? - Marginal REVOLUTION](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/07/the-changes-in-vibes-why-did-they-happen.html) (this is pre-election but turned out to be really prescient)

#### Selection Effects
[Selection Effects](https://capitalgains.thediff.co/p/selection-effects) by Byrne Hobart in the Capital Gains newsletter

The last para is killer, and I can really relate to it as a person with wayyy too many interests

> One irony of all of this is that these filters are self-reinforcing: if you select into a particular peer group that's really excited about political activism, recreational math, vegan cooking, cryptography, or whatever, you get constant evidence from your daily life that these are universally interesting topics. And if you've selected into these groups, you'd probably rather live in a world where that perception is true! So being aware of selection effects has tradeoffs: you'll know more about the rest of the world if you periodically check yourself in that way, but a lot of what you learn makes the world a slightly less friendly place.
