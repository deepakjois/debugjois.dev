Been rewatching Andor S1 since I tweeted about it a couple of days ago.

#### Tokyo
Lots of Indians are going to Tokyo, and I keep seeing pics on X. But they also seem to be doing the same stereotypical things, that I did back when I was there several years ago.

This NYT article about visiting Tokyo has a slightly offbeat 3-day itinerary: [36 Hours in Tokyo: Things to Do and See - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/04/06/travel/things-to-do-tokyo.html) #tokyo #japan #travel #offbeat

#### Jung Quote

> "People will do anything, no matter how absurd, in order to avoid facing their own souls. They will practice Indian yoga and all its exercises, observe a strict regimen of diet, learn theosophy by heart, or mechanically repeat mystic texts from the literature of the whole world â€“ all because they cannot get on with themselves and have not the slightest faith that anything useful could ever come out of their own souls."
