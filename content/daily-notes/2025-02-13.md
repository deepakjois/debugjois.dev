#### Chinese Marriages
[Why are Chinese Marriages Plummeting? - by Alice Evans](https://www.ggd.world/p/why-are-chinese-marriages-plummeting) #marriage #relationships 

> [China’s marriages have hit rock bottom](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-10/china-marriages-fall-to-record-low-as-demographic-crisis-deepens?embedded-checkout=true) - only 6.1 million weddings in 2024. This has massive economic consequences - fewer marriages mean mean fewer births, an ageing population, with declining labour productivity, and a rising dependency burden.

> Bloomberg blames marital collapse on [economic hardship](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-10/china-marriages-fall-to-record-low-as-demographic-crisis-deepens?embedded-checkout=true). But my interviews with Chinese young people suggest three further drivers.
> 
> 1. Cultural liberalisation means singledom is more permissible, while status is tied to economic success;
>     
> 2. Online connectivity enables young women to celebrate independence & equality;
>     
> 3. Men and women seem to be retreating into digital worlds.

#### NYT Amplifier: 10 Songs That Celebrate the Sound of Philadelphia
#music #playlist #nyt #amplifier 

> Across all sorts of genres, Philadelphia has a rich musical history and a vibrant musical present. The sound of Philadelphia soul defined the early 1970s (even David Bowie wanted [a piece of the action](https://nl.nytimes.com/f/a/2FjRjVb-na1eYg094bBq4w~~/AAAAARA~/HiKajK7ZfiVrIzi1jP6cMPQAqX74TSem2JGkOYD4q7elPp49qQ_Xwp3OyDAhYF_998muLfKqF-r0AyScE2vGSZdvIDwbUP24iDd_ZjTlG7X4MCKBOP2LY3glX53MGBigBIPs0zyftB9_KKXbN-ccoD2SBb33OznsnrYwBB9_IHhURMTpgabCj8S3nKjfuML-APrwpIqtCzg_hkVnGrxT3lIrYABfpvMRoIdzQoLoHfYBXcpUIlaotEpfSPAhCA79jAdBBBTzKXOdKdKPHmuwl7OjP_xHTF-s6KIxrm2e_fDlw8kJiTHlXxKwZRrLxkPgMiESS_tLGmeXWwuFX7jY7g~~)), and its heirs adapted its influence into a neo-soul boom that took off in the late 1990s. Philly has long had a thriving underground music scene, too, as evidenced by its tight-knit indie-rock community and its reputation for eclectic, innovative hip-hop.

#### USAID
[A World Without Aid? - by Oliver Kim - Global Developments](https://www.global-developments.org/p/a-world-without-aid) #aid #foreign #us #politics

> Most of my readers are likely deeply concerned about the wholesale destruction of USAID. They don’t need to be convinced further with statistics—that [19 million lives](https://pepfarreport.org/) have been saved by PEPFAR, that [434 of 634 vital soup kitchens in Khartoum](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/world/asia/trump-usaid-freeze.html) will have to shut down, that [$500 million of food aid](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/10/usaid-trump-elon-musk-cuts) is stuck rotting in warehouses rather than going to the hungry.

#### Tyler Cowen on Stablecoins

> Some history: The late 19th century brought [a unified gold standard](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/the-economy/monetary-policy/lessons-learned-from-the-gold-standard-implications-for-inflation-output-and-the-money-supply) to much of the world. The end of World War II brought the [Bretton Woods system](https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/bretton-woods-created), which [ended in 1971](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1969-1976/nixon-shock#:~:text=On%20August%2015%2C%201971%2C%20President,end%20of%20World%20War%20II.) with a new era of fiat money and floating exchange rates. [Crypto](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2022-the-crypto-story/) was invented in 2008, but the new monetary system that it enables has not become clear until recently.
> 
> Stablecoins are programmable crypto assets that promise conversion into some currency, typically US dollars. Currently, they are the fastest-growing sector of crypto. Stablecoin [usage](https://www.tronweekly.com/stablecoin-market-hits-224-billion-milestone/) is up 84% since August 2023 and is now at a peak of $224 billion. The sympathetic stance of President Donald Trump’s administration toward crypto is likely to help growth further.
> 
> It is noteworthy that, [measured](https://financialit.net/blog/stablecoins-cryptocurrencytrends-bitcoin/predictions-2025-rapid-rise-stablecoins-continues) by market capitalization, perhaps as much as 99% of stablecoins are denominated in dollars. That is a much higher share than is found in standard international trade and finance. This shows that, if monetary institutions were started all over again from scratch — which is part of what crypto is doing — the market would opt largely for dollars.

### How Much Protein Do We Actually Need?
[How Much Protein Do We Actually Need? - by Chris Gayomali](https://heavies.substack.com/p/how-much-protein-do-we-actually-need) #protein #health #exercise 

> The tl;dr is that proteinification is the coalescence of two main forces: the mainstreaming of fitness culture and capitalism’s remarkable ability to transform garbage into profit. Whey protein, for example, is a byproduct of cheese. Whey was historically treated as refuse, either dumped in our rivers or used as slop to feed pigs and cattle. And then some smart people realized that whey is actually nutrient-dense and could be refined into a powder and jammed into all sorts of stuff we eat, like protein bars. One cheesemaker’s trash is a fitness bro’s treasure.
