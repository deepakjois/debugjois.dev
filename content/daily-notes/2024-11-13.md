#### Dating Standards and Hot People

[Too much exposure to hot people is warping our dating standards | Dazed](https://www.dazeddigital.com/beauty/article/65066/1/too-much-exposure-to-hot-people-is-warping-our-dating-standards) #dating 

These quotes are so relatable 

> It’s been well established that the digital ubiquity of “unrealistic beauty standards” is whittling away at our self-esteem and mental health. What has been unpacked less exhaustively, however, is the impact it’s having on our dating lives. Online, [men](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGdRhNEyo/) are calling Sydney Sweeney and Margot Robbie “mid”, rating the latter a [seven](https://x.com/bizlet7/status/1678930051960635394?lang=en) out of ten on the universal scale of hotness, and a lot of my gorgeous friends lament never being hit on in real life. “Back in the olden days they [men] would see like 200 baddies in their whole life and now it’s like, they are desensitised to it,” posited influencer Tinx, to resounding agreement on [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@itsmetinxpodcast/video/7427904253299019050) and beyond. Over half of US adults say dating has gotten worse over the last [ten years](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/08/20/nearly-half-of-u-s-adults-say-dating-has-gotten-harder-for-most-people-in-the-last-10-years/). Has overexposure to good-looking people skyrocketed our standards?

> A 2014 [study](https://news.st-andrews.ac.uk/archive/casting-the-net/) conducted by Carlota Batres, assistant professor of psychology at Franklin & Marshall College and the director of the Preferences Lab, found that participants with access to the internet favoured more masculine men and thinner, more feminine women. “The internet influences our perceptions of what it is that we find attractive,” she tells Dazed. It’s a theory bolstered by a later [study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12110-017-9289-8#:~:text=Such%20distinctions%20would%20help%20us,in%20facial%20preferences%20across%20populations.) by Batres, which found that our visual diet – or the faces we see most (on or offline) – shapes our perception of what’s beautiful. It’s no wonder that a dissonance is occurring when we step out of the lacquered digital realm into the real world of idiosyncrasies and textured skin, where we’re illuminated by fluorescent overhead lighting instead of ring lights, and you see every angle of someone’s face.

> It’s a take echoed by psychologist and researcher Michelle Drouin: “I think you can put it down to basic habituation. We have now become habituated to the images that we’ve seen online and we think that that’s our reality… Physical attraction is what makes someone walk across the room for someone else. And if you don’t have that initial prime [attraction], because you’re so habituated to all the beautiful, perfect images that you see online, then what’s the trigger that makes you walk across a room?”
