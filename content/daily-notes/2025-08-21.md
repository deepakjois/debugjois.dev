[Stop talking about AI: Financial Times](https://on.ft.com/4lANVy7) #ai #hype

So, be doubtful when someone likens AI to the industrial revolution in importance. It will do well to match even the telephone and the incandescent lightbulb. (Incomes really surged as 1900 approached.) Perhaps the test of AI isn’t economic, though. Perhaps the test is quality of life. Well, before the phonograph, your favourite piece of music was something you only ever heard a few times, when an orchestra passed through town and fancied playing it. Before air travel, crossing an ocean was a Homeric saga. Now it is easy. AI will be as life-enhancing as these inventions, will it?

I so want to side with the AI sceptics. But look at their (my) own intellectual howlers. The two paragraphs above are too “inductive”: too reliant on the past as a guide to the future. There is also no technical detail because, unlike most of those who talk up AI, I don’t work in or around the field. And there are even worse AI-sceptic arguments. At least I didn’t lapse into anecdote, of the “ChatGPT told me to take heroin as a cold cure” variety.  As for the sensible line on AI, “wait and see”, that could be said about anything. It doesn’t tell investors what to do, or citizens how to prepare for the future.

In the end, there is just nothing very interesting to say about AI. There is lots of superb reporting. The major companies, the national strategies, the tech itself: keep abreast of it all. But when it comes to rumination and prognostication — the world of columnists and panel events — has there ever been a discourse so weak relative to its overall scale?
