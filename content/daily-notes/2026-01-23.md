#### Oliver Burkeman on "Unclenching"
[The Imperfectionist: The freewriting way of life](https://ckarchive.com/b/wvu2hghkm7066h9r552rqtnq2okxxs8hq2g6w)

> Freewriting, as you may know, is the technique whereby you set a timer, open a text file or notebook, then just write whatever comes to mind, even if it looks like absolute garbage. It’s been central to my process of clarifying and expressing ideas for a while now, despite the fact that it challenges every bit of my perfectionistic, control-freakish soul. More recently, though, I’ve started to see it as a microcosm for a whole way of being in the world. Because I think the principles of freewriting contain an entire philosophy for living a meaningful, vibrant, productive life – whether or not you happen to be a writer or use the technique itself.

> This is because freewriting is a form of what I’m going to call (perhaps regrettably) **unclenching** – a psychological “move” that involves relaxing in the midst of anxiety and uncertainty. Surrendering control, but thereby unleashing a vastly greater capacity for action, creativity and [aliveness](https://ckarchive.com/b/zlughnhk8772ma7qrr9qehwzgng00f6).
