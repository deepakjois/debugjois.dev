#### Gender Equality in Scandinavia
[Why is Scandinavia the Most Gender Equal Place in the World?](https://www.ggd.world/p/why-is-scandinavia-the-most-gender) #gender #inequality #equality #scandinavia

> Europe and North America escaped this trap through a fortunate confluence of factors: Christianity sanctified the nuclear family, the Protestant Reformation elevated [marital bonds](https://www.ggd.world/p/romantic-love-is-an-under-rated-driver), the Enlightenment championed free expression of [dissent](https://www.amazon.co.uk/What-Free-Speech-History-Dangerous/dp/0241347475), while robust states enforced laws and provided core services. Technological advances, media connectivity, and economic growth then proved transformative: women gained control over their fertility, pursued careers, built diverse friendships, demonstrated equal competence in socially valued domains, and mobilised for reform.
> 
> Yet Scandinavia had two unique latent assets which would prove transformative in the 20th century. Scandinavians never idealised female seclusion and there was a nascent culture of associations. Neither entailed gender equality, but rather they provided the latent assets for egalitarian ideological persuasion and capture of state power.

> Scandinavian Christianity retained remarkable permissiveness. Ibn Fadlan, travelling from Baghdad in 922, was shocked to see Scandinavian merchants having [sex with enslaved women in public view](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/comparative-studies-in-society-and-history/article/premarital-sexual-permissiveness-and-illegitimacy-in-the-nordic-countries/0F65000300835F743411FD3973AAE797). In 1432, a Venetian captain shipwrecked on Norway’s Lofoten archipelago noted locals [bathed naked together](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cross-Scepter-Scandinavian-Kingdoms-Reformation/dp/069116908X), unashamed.

> A hundred years later, Andrew Boorde observed Icelandic priests keeping [“concubynes](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/comparative-studies-in-society-and-history/article/premarital-sexual-permissiveness-and-illegitimacy-in-the-nordic-countries/0F65000300835F743411FD3973AAE797)”. 17th century travellers noted, with surprise, that bathhouses were sometimes [nude and gender-mixed](https://notchesblog.com/2019/03/19/some-like-it-hot-sex-and-the-sauna-in-early-modern-sweden/).
> 
> In northern Sweden and Finland, where agricultural productivity was low and class divisions were minimal, unmarried men and women might spend nights together without parental approval (‘_[nattfrieri](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Swedish-Theory-Love-Individualism-Scandinavian/dp/0295750553)_[’ - night courting)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Swedish-Theory-Love-Individualism-Scandinavian/dp/0295750553). In 1799, Malthus noted that Swedish country girls often had “[sweethearts for a considerable time before they marry](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/comparative-studies-in-society-and-history/article/premarital-sexual-permissiveness-and-illegitimacy-in-the-nordic-countries/0F65000300835F743411FD3973AAE797)” - frequently accelerated by pregnancy. Even in the late 19th century, 16% of first births to University of Iceland’s Theology Faculty were [illegitimate](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/comparative-studies-in-society-and-history/article/premarital-sexual-permissiveness-and-illegitimacy-in-the-nordic-countries/0F65000300835F743411FD3973AAE797).

> **What explains this permissiveness?**
> 
> Low population density, minimal urbanisation, and [sparse monasteries and bishoprics](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691245072/sacred-foundations) likely weakened the Church’s ideological control. Richard F. Tomasson argues, “[The older permissive pattern persisted in those areas where the influence of Christian conceptions of marriage was weakest”.](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/comparative-studies-in-society-and-history/article/premarital-sexual-permissiveness-and-illegitimacy-in-the-nordic-countries/0F65000300835F743411FD3973AAE797) This openness enabled high female labor force participation, but that’s only one part of Scandinavia’s feminist secret…

#### The Diderot Effect
The **Diderot Effect** is a social phenomenon where obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption, leading to acquiring more new things that complement or match the original item. This effect is named after the French philosopher Denis Diderot, who described how receiving a new robe made him want to replace his old belongings to match the new one, resulting in a cascade of purchases.

In essence, the Diderot Effect explains how one new purchase can lead to a chain reaction of additional spending to maintain a consistent lifestyle or aesthetic. #consumption #spiral
