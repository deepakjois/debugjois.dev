#### Gender Equality in Scandinavia
[Why is Scandinavia the Most Gender Equal Place in the World?](https://www.ggd.world/p/why-is-scandinavia-the-most-gender) #gender #inequality #equality #scandinavia

> Europe and North America escaped this trap through a fortunate confluence of factors: Christianity sanctified the nuclear family, the Protestant Reformation elevated [marital bonds](https://www.ggd.world/p/romantic-love-is-an-under-rated-driver), the Enlightenment championed free expression of [dissent](https://www.amazon.co.uk/What-Free-Speech-History-Dangerous/dp/0241347475), while robust states enforced laws and provided core services. Technological advances, media connectivity, and economic growth then proved transformative: women gained control over their fertility, pursued careers, built diverse friendships, demonstrated equal competence in socially valued domains, and mobilised for reform.
> 
> Yet Scandinavia had two unique latent assets which would prove transformative in the 20th century. Scandinavians never idealised female seclusion and there was a nascent culture of associations. Neither entailed gender equality, but rather they provided the latent assets for egalitarian ideological persuasion and capture of state power.
