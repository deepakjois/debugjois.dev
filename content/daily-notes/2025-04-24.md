#### How to teach yourself about AI
[How to teach yourself about AI - by Mike White](https://www.thisgenomiclife.org/p/how-to-teach-yourself-about-ai?r=17wsq&triedRedirect=true) #ai #learning #books

> One of the most important abilities you need for a successful career is knowing how to update your skills. As I tell my kids, this isn’t just important advice for scientists, who work in a profession that is supposed to generate new knowledge and new technology, and thus is always changing. The _New York Times_ [recently covered](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/28/style/gen-x-creative-work.html?unlocked_article_code=1.8E4.76ac.YT0mGnleljN6&smid=url-share) the “Gen X career meltdown”, describing the challenges of media professionals who entered journalism, advertising, film, etc. in the 1990’s and early 2000’s. The media business looks nothing like it did 20-30 years ago.

> In that spirit, I want to encourage everyone learn more about AI, including scientists whose training and work may be mostly non-computational. Especially if you’re still early in your career, you have time to build your skills and bring deep learning into your work. To be clear, if you’re serious about doing computational biology, you’ll need to do more than just read some books; you’ll need to spend some time training with real computational biologists. But it is possible to, in the words of Harvard computational biologist Sean Eddy, “ go where a question takes you, not where your training left you.”

> For the antedsciplinary scientists (and non-scientists) out there, here are my recommendations for books to learn AI. They range from gentle and popular introductions to fantastic textbooks that rigorously cover the math. (Eddy’s piece, by the way, helped tip the scales in favor of my decision to come to Washington University in St. Louis, where Eddy was at the time. I wanted to be around people who thought like that.)


#### What Happens When Everything Becomes a Meme
[What Happens When Everything Becomes a Meme?](https://kyla.substack.com/p/what-happens-when-everything-becomes) #meme #commons 

> In economics, the **tragedy of the commons** is what happens when a shared resource - like farmland, fisheries, or clean air - is exploited so extensively that it eventually collapses. Today, we're experiencing a modern variation of this tragedy, not just in physical resources, but in our essential societal infrastructure:
> 
> - **The social commons**: trust, relationships, community.
> - **The cognitive commons**: curiosity, education, critical thought.
> - **The economic commons**: stable markets, shared prosperity, institutional trust.
> - **The informational commons**: language, reality, basic consensus.
> 
> Unlike traditional commons, which collapse through actual physical depletion, these invisible resources are slowly dismantled through systemic incentives that reward isolation, compliance, instability, and division.

on the social commons

> And honestly, a society built on transactional interactions and shallow connections is inherently fragile. People who can't trust each other in daily life don't suddenly trust each other at the ballot box. People who can't commit to friendships or partners might have trouble committing to democratic institutions or civic engagement. I am being sweeping in my assertions, but think of the foundation - a society without stable relationships can't sustain stable democracies.
> 
> Without genuine community ties, citizens disengage. Civic participation declines, and as [Guy Debord warned us](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/14/guy-debord-society-spectacle-will-self) - politics devolves into spectacle rather than substance.

on the cognitive commons

> Anne Helen Petersen has a nice essay on that [here](https://annehelen.substack.com/p/what-is-millennial-hobby-energy), writing “the logic we’ve internalized is pernicious and persistent: if you’re spending time doing something, and there’s a _potential_ to make money off that thing, leaving that money on the table is fiscally irresponsible.” The obsessive, monetized pursuit of hobbies isn't mere escapism but a reaction to general pressures: education-driven burnout, economic precarity, and performative living. It's a way for people to assert identity and agency within structural limitations. Optimization, efficiency, monetization. Repeat!
>
> Without curiosity or critical thinking, we become vulnerable to manipulation, susceptible to polarizing narratives, and ultimately lose the ability to make independent judgments, which is really important for democratic citizenship.

on the economic commons

> We burned our economic commons, not because it makes sense, but because our political leaders have confused economic policy with personal vendettas. The market for chaos is booming, and trust is evaporating.

on the informational commons

> The informational commons - language, reality, and basic consensus - is collapsing because we've monetized division. Social media platforms aren't built for clarity or understanding; they're optimized for engagement, outrage, and polarization. Algorithms don't reward nuance; they reward certainty, controversy, and emotional triggers.
> 
> What replaces consensus reality? Loyalty realities. Tribal realities. Personalized realities!! We no longer debate ideas or solutions - we debate whose facts count, whose feelings matter, whose truth wins. Truth itself becomes a loyalty test, not a shared ground. And without a shared informational commons, cooperation becomes impossible. We don’t solve problems, we fight over who gets to define them! Language is weaponized and reality is fractured.

and finally

> Each of these commons has been chipped away, monetized, and exploited. Social trust turned into transactional loneliness. Curiosity replaced by compliance and cognitive outsourcing. Stable economic governance overtaken by chaotic spectacle. Shared reality splintered into competing tribes and personalized truths.


> The societal infrastructure isn't gone forever. Unlike a depleted fishery or farmland, these intangible resources can regenerate if we choose connection over transaction, critical thought over compliance, substance over spectacle, and shared reality over isolated tribes, etc. But, you know, for now… bitcoin?
#### Millenial Hobby Energy
[What is Millennial Hobby Energy? - by Anne Helen Petersen](https://annehelen.substack.com/p/what-is-millennial-hobby-energy) #hobby #hustle #culture 

> Many bourgeois or upwardly aspirational millennials have a hobby story similar to mine. Maybe they had a period in their teens or early 20s where they did something just because they liked it. But most people came to understand activities as “achievements” early on: if you’re doing something that’s not directly related to grades, then it should be extremely legible as a line on your college resume.
> 
> If you did what we called an extra-curricular, it was less because it was fun, or because you _wanted to_, but because “it looked good,” or communicated something “interesting” or “well-rounded” about your personality. And when you instrumentalize leisure in this way, you lose touch with your understanding of what leisure even _is_. Did you like basketball? Did you like playing the piano? Or did you do it because it — or something like it — was _what you did_?
> 
> Within this framework, there was very little room for activities that resisted narrativization in a college essay. Hobbies that didn’t produce something, or help someone, establish you as superlative, or in some way highlight your entrepreneurial spirit weren’t really hobbies at all. They were fucking around: invisible, if not altogether shameful. Listening to music = not a hobby. Scrapbooking = not a hobby. Zine making could be a hobby, but only if you distributed it to every high school in your metro area and formed a movement around it, etc. etc. (On this subject, I always refer people to Malcolm Harris’s _Kids These Days_, which outlines how millennials came to understand themselves as a product to be ameliorated).
