Caught a bad sore throat. Looks like I will be staying in for a couple of days.

> The lesson, to reiterate, isn’t that you ought to start a religion. It’s that if that old windbag can do so, you can probably have a go at launching any project about which you’ve been experiencing self-doubt – and that there’s no reason why you can’t be the one to make a fortune, or a long-lasting difference to the world, as a result. Likewise, if you’ve been thinking of making a radical change in your life – traveling the world in midlife, say, or educating your kids outside the school system – there’s a solid chance you can scrabble together the resources and figure out a way. You won’t feel like you know what you’re doing. But nobody ever does; that’s just how it is for finite humans, attempting new things. The main difference between those who accomplish great things anyway and those who don’t is that the former don’t mind not knowing. They were not less flawed or finite than you. Everything they ever did was done by people.

This chapter is titled  _What matters: On finding your way_

> And so I won’t be concluding here by revealing the meaning of life. But I do have thoughts.
> 
> The first is that it simply need not follow, from our cosmic insignificance as individuals, that our actions don’t matter. The idea that things only count if they count on the vastest scale is one more expression of our discomfort with finitude: accepting that they might count only transiently, or locally, requires us to face our limitations and our mortality. And so to avoid that unpleasantness, as the philosopher Iddo Landau has explained, we gravitate towards an unnecessarily grandiose standard of what matters – then get demoralized when our achievements don’t make the grade. We feel pressured to do something extraordinary with our lives, or to an extraordinary standard of merit, or in a way that’s applauded by an extraordinary number of people – even though it’s true by definition that only a few people can ever be extraordinary in any given domain. (If we could all stand out from the crowd, there’d be no crowd from which to stand out.) Why shouldn’t an anonymous career spent quietly helping a few people get to qualify as a meaningful way to spend one’s time? Why shouldn’t an absorbing conversation, an act of kindness, or an exhilarating hike get to count? Why adopt a definition that rules such things out?
