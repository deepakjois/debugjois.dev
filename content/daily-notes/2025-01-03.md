#### Meditations for Mortals Day Twenty Seven
This chapter is titled _C’est fait par du monde: On giving it a shot_

> The lesson, to reiterate, isn’t that you ought to start a religion. It’s that if that old windbag can do so, you can probably have a go at launching any project about which you’ve been experiencing self-doubt – and that there’s no reason why you can’t be the one to make a fortune, or a long-lasting difference to the world, as a result. Likewise, if you’ve been thinking of making a radical change in your life – traveling the world in midlife, say, or educating your kids outside the school system – there’s a solid chance you can scrabble together the resources and figure out a way. You won’t feel like you know what you’re doing. But nobody ever does; that’s just how it is for finite humans, attempting new things. The main difference between those who accomplish great things anyway and those who don’t is that the former don’t mind not knowing. They were not less flawed or finite than you. Everything they ever did was done by people.
