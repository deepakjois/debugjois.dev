> A Boston-based startup called Pure Lithium recently announced a **[breakthrough with its lithium metal batteries](https://link.recode.net/click/38487295.36005/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2hvbWUvMjAyNTAxMDY4MDUwOTMvZW4vUHVyZS1MaXRoaXVtJUUyJTgwJTk5cy1Ob3ZlbC1MaXRoaXVtLU1ldGFsLUJhdHRlcnktQWNoaWV2ZXMtVW5wcmVjZWRlbnRlZC1DeWNsaW5nLVJlc3VsdHM_dWVpZD03YWFhYmYwZDcxOTMzZjk3NmM1NWIwZjRiMWJkOWY4OCNuZXdfdGFi/62e73e4945ad6bf6110e6176B3e9db96b).** While the lithium-ion batteries in your phone start to degrade significantly after a few hundred cycles of charging and discharging, these lithium metal batteries, which use pure lithium rather than a lithium compound, can last over 2,000 cycles without significant damage degradation, an ongoing test shows. Plus, the lithium metal batteries can store twice as much energy and weigh half as much as conventional lithium-ion batteries. Pure Lithium cofounder and CEO Emilie Bodoin calls this combination of features “the holy grail of energy storage.”

#### httptap
[GitHub - monasticacademy/httptap: View HTTP/HTTPS requests made by any Linux program](https://github.com/monasticacademy/httptap) #go #networking #tools 

> When you run `httptap -- <command>`, httptap runs `<command>` in an isolated network namespace, injecting a certificate authority created on-the-fly in order to decrypt HTTPS traffic.

Written in Go, runs only on Linux.

> Httptap only runs on linux at present. It makes use of linux-specific system calls -- in particular network namespaces -- that will unfortunately make it very difficult to port to other operating systems. If you know how httptap could be ported to other operating systems then please get in touch!

#### Monastic Academy
I was reading the README of the httptap and I came across this: #buddhism #ai

> Httptap is part of an experiment in developing technology in the context of Buddhist monasticism. It was developed at the [Monastic Academy](https://www.monasticacademy.org/) in Vermont in the US. We believe that a monastic schedule, and the practice of the Buddhist spiritual path more generally, provide ideal conditions for technological development. The way we have set things up is that we live and practice together on a bit over a hundred acres of land. In the mornings and evenings we chant and meditate together, and for about one week out of every month we run and participate in a meditation retreat. The rest of the time we work together on everything from caring for the land, maintaining the buildings, cooking, cleaning, planning, fundraising, and for the past few years developing software together. This project is a demonstration of what is possible on the software side, but of course to see the full product of our work you should come visit us.
> 
> If you're interested, we run an [AI fellowship program](https://www.monasticacademy.org/ai-fellowship), which is a funded month-to-month program where you live on the land, participate in the schedule, and do your own work during the day. We also have a 3-month [monastic training program](https://www.monasticacademy.org/train), which can lead into our long-term residential training.
> 
> For the past few years we have been recording a lecture series called [Buddhism for AI](https://buddhismforai.sutra.co/). It's about our efforts to design a religion (yes, a religion) based on Buddhism for consumption directly by AI systems. We actually feel this is very important work given the world situation.
> 
> Finally, our head teacher [Soryu Forall](https://www.monasticacademy.org/teacher) published a book a few years back called [Buddhism For All](https://buddhism.net/buddhism-for-all-book/). We're working on a sequel at the moment.

I should join an AI commune and just work on side projects and meditate all day! This photo is just lovely.

#### the way a sovereign currency "works"
![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i35uBVeNp6c)

This is the clearest explanation of how a sovereign currency works using the framework of Modern Monetary Theory (MMT). You don't even have to endorse MMT, just pay attention to the beginning of the lecture where Wray quotes from the St Louis Fed and prominent economists on why they continue to perpetuate the false claim that the US government can _"run out of money"_. #mmt #money #sovereign #debt #deficit

> Recently, there's a paper from the St. Louis Fed. Let me read this and then translate it. The St. Louis Fed, if you don't know, is a bastion of monetarism. This is Milton Friedman type economics. What I'm telling you is accepted from right to left: "As the sole manufacturer of dollars, whose debt is denominated in dollars, the U.S. government can never become insolvent, i.e., unable to pay its bills. In this sense, the government is not dependent on credit markets to remain operational. Moreover, there will always be a market for U.S. government debt at home because the U.S. government has the only means of creating risk-free dollar-denominated assets."
> 
> Let me translate: the government can never run out of dollars, it can never be forced to default, it can never be forced to miss a payment. It is never subject to the whims of bond vigilantes. That's what the St. Louis Fed tells us, and you can find virtually identical quotes from Bernanke, from Greenspan, and really from almost all economists. When President Obama tells you we're running out of money, that the piggy bank is empty, that is just not true, and all economists know that it's not true.
> 
> The question is, why do they lie to you? There's a nice little video blog in which he interviews Paul Samuelson. I won't read this long thing; you can see the PowerPoint later. He says there's an element of truth in the *superstition that the budget must be balanced at all times*. But then later on, he talks about over longer periods of time. He likens it to an *old-fashioned religion used to scare people so that they will behave in a particular way*. He says, "*We have taken away a belief in the intrinsic necessity of balancing the budget, if not every year, then over a short period of time."* If Prime Minister Gladstone came back to life, he would say, "Uh-oh, what have you done?" And James Buchanan argues in those terms. I see merit in that view. He likens it to a superstition, an old-time religion. We have to do this because we have a fear that our elected representatives will spend without limit, and so we make up this lie that the federal government is like a U.S. household. You hear this all the time in debates about the budget, that the U.S. government is like a household. That is not true. Unless you have a printing press in your basement and you're printing up dollars, you are nothing like the federal government. The federal government creates money as it spends.

#### MAGA Obsession for the 1950s family
[Brooding: Trad or Not, We’re All Nostalgic for a Fake Past](https://www.thecut.com/article/trad-wife-imagined-conservative-nostalgia.html) #marriage #family #relationships 

> Conservatives are years deep into a period of raging [nostalgia](https://www.thecut.com/2023/12/how-much-nostalgia-for-the-holidays-should-we-have.html) for a fake past, the historical details of which most people have a sketchy grasp on at best. They’re not nostalgic for the ’50s as it actually was — a time of government largesse, with huge spending on education and housing — but the ’50s as it exists in the imaginations of many white Americans: as the peak of “normal” white American culture. This is where our ideas about what a “typical American family” looks like tend to originate. The very concepts of the nuclear family, of “family” as a consumer category, of the roles that each member of a family are understood to play (“girl dad,” anyone?): All of this flows from mass media of the 1950s. Even though family life today bears little resemblance to that time, the aesthetic aura of the 1950s family has had diabolical staying power in our popular culture, a recent example being, of course, the whole [“trad” thing](https://www.thecut.com/2023/09/tradwife-content-influencers-conservative-ideology.html).

and suddenly in the middle of the article, there is some actually insightful marriage advice!

> But all this effort and expectation that we put into our family relationships is a double-edged sword, according to Coontz. Couples spend so much time together, trying to fulfill their obligations correctly, that they are losing the social connections they need to stay sane.
> 
> “Date nights are the worst marriage advice that I’ve ever heard of,” she said. The tyranny of one-on-one time, according to Coontz, is bad for everyone.
>
> “We have to understand that it’s a win-win situation if we cultivate our single friends and our single lives and our single skills,” she continued. “It brings new life to our marriage, but it also protects us in two ways. It protects us against asking too much from our marriage, and if we leave our marriage, we already have social networks, so we don’t have to start all over.”
>
> But the convenience structures of everyday life, from streaming to DoorDash, conspire to keep us more isolated from our communities than we could be, and more enmeshed in family structures that continue to resemble the historical anomaly of the 1950s nuclear family.

#### The Attention Singularity
[Trumpcoin and TikTok - by kyla scanlon - Kyla’s Newsletter](https://kyla.substack.com/p/trumpcoin-and-tiktok) #attention #power 

> This is the birth of the **Attention Singularity**, where power, narrative, and wealth merge into one self-reinforcing system.
>
> Think of the Attention Singularity like a black hole, but instead of gravity, it's attention that becomes so powerful it warps reality itself. We're watching the birth of a system where attention directly creates wealth (like $60B from Trumpcoin in 36 hours), wealth instantly enables power (potential TikTok acquisition), power captures more attention (platform control), and each cycle gets faster and stronger than the last.
>
> Traditional limits like physical constraints, geographic boundaries, or institutional checks stop mattering because digital attention moves instantly and globally, while narrative overpowers physical reality. Once this feedback loop starts, it's self-reinforcing: attention creates wealth, wealth enables power, power shapes perceived reality, and reality drives more attention.
>
> I am being sweepingly dramatic in these statements, but they are important to think about.

Reminds me of the _Homo Interneticus_ concept I posted about last month.

#### Placebo Effect of Therapy
[The Placebo Effect in Therapy (Part 2/2) - by Josh Zlatkus](https://thelivingfossils.substack.com/p/the-placebo-effect-in-therapy-22) #placebo #therapy #mentalhealth 

I quoted part 1 earlier.

> The way I see it, psychotherapy is no different than [surreal caves](https://thelivingfossils.substack.com/p/the-placebo-effect-in-therapy-part), [psychiatric medication](https://thelivingfossils.substack.com/p/exactly-how-bogus-is-psychiatry), religion, Reiki, or whatever the hell [this](https://brainspotting.com/about-bsp/what-is-brainspotting/) is. They are all _platforms for belief_, in addition to whatever else they might be.
>
> The fact that psychotherapy is a platform for belief helps to explain why different versions nevertheless produce similar results. Therapeutic methods are akin to religious sects in that arguments about the “right” sect are pointless because the basic premise of a God just isn’t true. The healing value of religion isn’t in getting the “facts” right; it’s in sharing something to believe in. Ditto with therapy.

…

> So, therapy is fake—is placebo—in its stated means of operation, but real in its delivered effect. A dialectical behavior therapist, for example, might think the client is improving because they are finally doing their homework. Yet it’s more likely that the client is improving because someone cares enough about them to assign homework and insist that it gets done. Most of the stuff that psychotherapists have long hung their hat upon—delivering brilliant interpretations, creating self-aware and compliant clients, uncovering the root cause of all subsequent illness—is irrelevant outside of its ability to legitimize the therapy, to make it seem like serious business with a good chance of success. Such content becomes the foreground, allowing the actual process of healing—via common factors such as the relationship and placebo—to operate smoothly in the background.
> 
> But the elusive mechanisms of healing by common factors helps to explain why we do not typically identify them as central—why clients will often say that therapy has been helpful and then balk at the natural follow-up of “why?” The reality is that they don’t know; and most times, neither does the therapist.

…

> Here are some implications for the field if everything I’ve said is true:
> 
> 1. The main value of therapeutic training is _signaling_ value, which strengthens the placebo effect. The patient’s knowledge that their therapist has a Ph.D. contributes more to their healing than whatever their therapist happened to learn (or unlearn) in those 5-7 years.
>     
> 2. If therapeutic training were designed to be _technically_ helpful, it would focus on how to leverage common factors. For example: how to build strong relationships, listen carefully, facilitate open conversation, and use placebo. Training should also focus on what _is_ knowable about mental health, much of which comes from an evolutionary perspective. For example, that [emotions measure and motivate](https://thelivingfossils.substack.com/p/emotions-measure-and-motivate), or that emotions can [misfire](https://thelivingfossils.substack.com/p/the-action-words-of-emotions) on the principle “better safe than sorry.”
>     
> 3. Many alternatives to therapy exist. Most of these alternatives are less costly. If we want to give everyone access to mental health, these low-cost, widely-accessible alternatives should be front and center. Yes, I’m talking about diet, sleep, exercise, and social connection.[11](https://thelivingfossils.substack.com/p/the-placebo-effect-in-therapy-22#footnote-11-156468198)
>     
> 4. The field should stop wasting its time comparing therapies. Someone ought to knock CBT off its high horse specifically.[12](https://thelivingfossils.substack.com/p/the-placebo-effect-in-therapy-22#footnote-12-156468198)

#### How do exchange rates work
[How Do Exchange Rates Work, Anyway? - by Oliver Kim](https://www.global-developments.org/p/how-do-exchange-rates-work-anyway) #money #exchange #dollar

> Before I get to the mechanics of exchange rates and trade—somewhat in the news these days—let me start off with some fortune cookie koans about the nature of Truth:
> 
> - Lawyers: what’s provable is True.
>     
> - Artists: what’s authentic is True.
>     
> - Politicians: what’s popular is True.
>     
> - Practitioners: what works is True.
>     
> - Academics: what’s correct is True.

> One immediate wrinkle is that firms, being firms, can smell a buck to be made. If the złoty falls—in effect, setting an international discount on Polish goods—they may raise their złoty prices a tad, offsetting a bit of the depreciation but allowing them to increase their profits. So some of the exchange rate depreciation is eaten by firms; the “passthrough” to prices observed by importers may be incomplete

> Around 40% of all global trade is invoiced in US dollars, even though only 10% of global trade is destined for the United States. A similarly large share of world trade (around 46%) is invoiced in the Euro, but this is much more in line with the Euro Area’s share of world trade (37%). Over 80% of global goods and services are thus listed in terms of just these two currencies—and, in particular, 30% of global trade is invoiced in US dollars, even when America is not necessarily involved in the transaction.

#### Sports Betting and Robinhood
[Robinhood Wanted B\*ts on the B\*g G\*me](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-02-04/robinhood-wanted-b-ts-on-the-b-g-g-me)

> The other set of euphemisms is of course the use of words like “event contracts,” “derivatives” and, my favorite, “emerging asset class.” Robinhood will let you put in some money to predict that either the Philadelphia Unnamed Team or the Kansas City Unnamed Team will win the Large Football Contest. If your team loses the football contest, you lose the money you put in. If your team wins the football contest, you get back more than you put in. It’s a derivative contract, see? Are you _betting on football_? No no no no no no no no no no, this is an _emerging asset class_.

and then, what a load of crock

> The announcement [went on](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/u/click?_t=f574328d4d0c4c359b90d8e49b10e21d&_m=61a1d1c295944b259f5fc1faa8a629ed&_e=lP5vp3PFM9EG7oAxmd4DHiFj1wA0jk2R0AFToe2NJsMoZeY6rOW56vV9RnBmidHg3b4TKWuSCNF_dqxf4nUYbnl2Q5j8Vs1R05UrdH-xM1xX_lPIpK_wya8na7OKigWVxxQ4zFakQd7F1MW48QZV6qqx9H7zcq88lhM6nZmsXm9qNwUByVqlfRfDopGM-d_qNK5OFSQxZkAP_0FiEkqg2Nrq_d6_zHfuE8OCwpUn8S6WhVMz6d7-eUnIQp8OvqXnsbJupEmZDFN3-04JjohyyB7_BvSerhsfjTKz1yw0-jh5lBj5XyPV5r8SlEU_DvHTZrkeVvTWTfcDkqIuaD8ob5paoaTxhh1abV7HxPhZ56Say66cOS2ytZYTsggZuZED1XCCkypnOpNABcyPqscqNISJcjuc2E4RK6daPJw9W-mTKjMK_QIpAn3S6AUrdhTT):

> >

> 
> “Our mission is to democratize finance for all” would be an _absolutely incredible_ slogan for an online sportsbook, or a casino, or for that matter an old-time Mafia bookie. Robinhood surely _does_ help a lot of people save for retirement with lower costs than they paid at pre-Robinhood brokerages, but in _this_ case, “democratize finance for all” means “get people to bet on sports.” “Leverage the power and rigor of financial market structure to facilitate greater liquidity, transparency, and price discovery” also means “get people to bet on sports.” Rigor!
