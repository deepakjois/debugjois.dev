#### 10 books that are dating red flags
[10 books that are dating red flags | Dazed](https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/66662/1/liking-any-of-these-10-books-is-an-immediate-red-flag-lolita-american-psycho) #dating #books

I first thought the title was a bit unserious, but the actual article turned out to be very insightful and funny.

On A Clockwork Orange

> It’s a thought-provoking read and probably one of my favourite books, but if the person you’re dating thinks Alex is some kind of aspirational antihero, it’s safe to say you should probably run a mile.

On American Psycho

> So if a man you’re dating loves _American Psycho,_ just try to make sure this is due to its trenchant critique of consumer-capitalism, and not because he thinks Patrick Bateman is a based alpha giga-chad.

TIL, there is such a thing as "dude-bro" books:

> I’ve always been perplexed by the idea that there are large numbers of obnoxious literary bros out there, bragging about having read _Infinite Jest_ and terrorising the people around them with Jack Kerouac quotes. I have met a handful of men like that in my life, but they don’t exist as a meaningful constituency – most men simply don’t read fiction, if they read at all. If I met someone who loved Pynchon, DeLillo, Bolaño or any other author from the “dude bro” canon, I’d be more inclined to think of them as interesting than as pretentious.

On All About Love by Bell Hooks

> I actually don’t think _All About Love_ is inherently a red flag book. But it can be alarming to many when certain people (men) have this book in their possession. When I think about _All About Love_, I think of that picture a guy took of himself on a beach reading it, and everyone commented that he was only on page one and was already taking pictures of himself 😭. _All About Love_ has become associated with a kind of performance for men. It often sits on the corner of their desks collecting dust, but it’s there so that any potential romantic partner they bring home will be impressed by their supposed desire to engage with hooks’ work and better themselves. Beyond that, I know people have a lot of problems with _All About Love_, especially because hooks writes that love and abuse cannot coexist. When I first read the book at 17, that particular line triggered one of the worst mental breakdowns I’ve had to date. Now that I’m 25, I understand that what people write in books isn’t always fact and that they can be wrong.

On Crime and Punishment

> If you’re seeing someone who is reading a book by Fyodor Dostoevsky, good news! They have a brain cell. The bad news, however, is that that brain cell is deficient in serotonin; this person likely takes themselves quite seriously, has a morose outlook on life, and struggles with chronic depression (at least, if they didn’t when they started it, they will have developed it by the time they’ve finished it).
