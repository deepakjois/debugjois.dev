#### 10 books that are dating red flags
[10 books that are dating red flags | Dazed](https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/66662/1/liking-any-of-these-10-books-is-an-immediate-red-flag-lolita-american-psycho)

I first thought the title was a bit unserious, but the actual article turned out to be very insightful and funny.

On A Clockwork Orange

> Itâ€™s a thought-provoking read and probably one of my favourite books, but if the person youâ€™re dating thinks Alex is some kind of aspirational antihero, itâ€™s safe to say you should probably run a mile.

On American Psycho

> So if a man youâ€™re dating lovesÂ _American Psycho,_Â just try to make sure this is due to its trenchant critique of consumer-capitalism, and not because he thinks Patrick Bateman is a based alpha giga-chad.

On All About Love by Bell Hooks

> I actually donâ€™t thinkÂ _All About Love_Â is inherently a red flag book. But it can be alarming to many when certain people (men) have this book in their possession. When I think aboutÂ _All About Love_, I think of that picture a guy took of himself on a beach reading it, and everyone commented that he was only on page one and was already taking pictures of himself ðŸ˜­.Â _All About Love_Â has become associated with a kind of performance for men. It often sits on the corner of their desks collecting dust, but itâ€™s there so that any potential romantic partner they bring home will be impressed by their supposed desire to engage with hooksâ€™ work and better themselves. Beyond that, I know people have a lot of problems withÂ _All About Love_,Â especiallyÂ because hooks writes that love and abuse cannot coexist. When I first read the book at 17, that particular line triggered one of the worst mental breakdowns Iâ€™ve had to date. Now that Iâ€™m 25, I understand that what people write in books isnâ€™t always fact and that they can be wrong.

On Crime and Punishment

> If youâ€™re seeing someone who is reading a book by Fyodor Dostoevsky, good news! They have a brain cell. The bad news, however, is that that brain cell is deficient in serotonin; this person likely takes themselves quite seriously, has a morose outlook on life, and struggles with chronic depression (at least, if they didnâ€™t when they started it, they will have developed it by the time theyâ€™ve finished it).
