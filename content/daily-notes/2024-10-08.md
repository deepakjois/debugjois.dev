> Not a clinical diagnosis but more a way of locating oneself in relation to others, and popularised by a number of social media platforms, MCS is a tendency to view one’s life as a story in which one stars in the central role, with everyone else a side character at best. Only the star’s perspectives, desires, loves, hatreds and opinions matter, while those of others in supporting roles are relegated to the periphery of awareness. Main characters act while everyone else reacts. Main characters demand attention and the rest of us had better obey.

>  MCS is not a puzzle to be solved via a ‘do and don’t’ listicle. It is not a social problem against which laws can be passed. Instead, it calls on us to engage in what Joseph Campbell, among others, called a ‘dark night of the soul’. This might mean sitting with our anonymity, solitude, boredom and lostness; pushing back on the equivocation between performance and authentic connections; making ourselves vulnerable to others, and thus to failure. It might mean seeing ourselves as always incomplete – and recognising that fulfilment might not be in the cards, that life is not a triumphant monomyth, and others are not here to be cast in supporting roles. Myself, I tend to turn to [Samuel Beckett](https://aeon.co/essays/how-samuel-beckett-sought-salvation-in-the-midst-of-suffering)’s play _Endgame_ (1957), where a character reminds us: ‘You’re on earth, there’s no cure for that!’ Sounds about right – let’s begin there.

> The AI discourse is polarized because of differing opinions about which AI risks matter, how serious and urgent they are, and what to do about them. In broad strokes:
> 
> - The AI safety community considers catastrophic AI risks a major societal concern, and supports government intervention. It has strong ties to the effective altruism movement. 
>     
> - e/acc is short for effective accelerationism, a play on effective altruism. It is a libertarian movement that sees tech as the solution and rejects government intervention.
>     
> - The AI ethics community focuses on materialized harms from AI such as discrimination and labor exploitation, and sees the focus on AI safety as a distraction from those priorities.

#### nvim setup (contd.)
Watched this: [Full Neovim Setup from Scratch in 2024 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYDG3AHgYEs)

Installed plugins and tweaked configs. Made sure I was reading the docs for every line of code that I was adding to the config file.

Had to add these two lines in my `~/.tmux.conf` to get neovim fonts to look right, with italics and everything. No idea why exactly it works. #tmux #tools #config

```
set -g default-terminal "tmux-256color"
set-option -g focus-events on
set-option -a terminal-features 'xterm-256color:RGB'
```
