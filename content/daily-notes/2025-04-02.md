#### Means of Production vs Means of Connecting 
[The Algorithmic Holiday - by Brett Scott](https://www.asomo.co/p/the-algorithmic-holiday) #capitalism #gig #economy 

> The Gig Economy platforms, by contrast, run a lean version of this. A company like Uber knows that it doesn’t actually need to own tens of thousands of cars - the Means of Production - provided that it owns an information and management architecture that stands between those productive assets and society: Uber owns the **Means of Connecting**, rather than the Means of Production, which means they can still be a gatekeeper between workers and consumers, while outsourcing finance costs to the individual workers.

#### Choosing Next.js

A breakdown of how Next.js seems to be tied to Vercel in many ways, who don't seem to care about being good open source stewards.

- Lack of adapters
- No official serverless support
- Vercel-Specific, Undocumented Code Paths
- Poor Security Incident Handling
- Lack of transparency in governance

#### Beauty and Relationships

> So much of romantic relationships is about pressing yourself into a shape you do not recognise, as Faye so accurately puts it. We are told that women are meant to be hyper-feminine and that the right man will put you in your “[feminine energy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=rDt2SXazfXo&t=0s&ab_channel=JillzGuerin)”, as divine feminine con-influencers incessantly express online. But this isn’t a natural state of being as we are so often told, but a naturalised one. We act this way because we are told to and because it gets the best reception from both our desired partners and from the public.


> Nobody knows what Leclerc and Mleux’s relationship is like, and yet they assume it’s good because she is beautiful and feminine and adheres to her gender correctly. Conversely, so does he – Leclerc is seen as being good-looking and is immersed in the hyper-masculine and perilous world of motor racing. We praise certain relationships and those within them for their ability to keep up with appearances.

> This is not surprising. As beauty critic, [Jessica DeFino](https://www.dazeddigital.com/beauty/article/62129/1/does-having-bad-morals-really-make-you-ugly-dune-beauty-timothee-chalamet) wrote in her newsletter last year, as a society, we tend to have the moral code of Disney cartoons. We superficially believe that beauty is good; thus, a beautiful couple must have a healthy relationship (look at the contrast with how people talk about and aspire to [Dua Lipa and Callum Turner’s relationship](https://x.com/dreamysoulc/status/1895456432088306106)). When we see people we perceive as “ugly” (ie who sit outside narrow European beauty standards), we are quick to [assume the worst](https://www.dazeddigital.com/beauty/article/62129/1/does-having-bad-morals-really-make-you-ugly-dune-beauty-timothee-chalamet). That their relationship must be bad, that something must be wrong, that they are not really in love. This is exactly why people feel the need to change and transform themselves beyond recognition. It seems contrary to what we ask of people when we are looking for love in the first place. We ask that people genuinely love us for who we are, but the world repeatedly proves that we will only be rewarded for looking a certain way, for not being or looking like ourselves.

> In her book _Right Wing Women,_ radical feminist Andrea Dworkin writes that “the tragedy is that women so committed to survival cannot recognise that they are committing suicide.” Dworkin was making a specific reference here to right-wing women who make accommodations to male domination for their own survival. But when I read that quote, I immediately thought about beauty and relationships and the ways we transform ourselves entirely for love and survival. But we deserve to do way more in this life than just survive.

> We “survive” by adhering to our gender roles, with their own built-in violence that often result in tragedy. We “survive” by adhering to beauty standards, where people go under the knife and [sometimes do not wake up](https://www.dazeddigital.com/beauty/article/66363/1/phenol-peels-the-truth-about-the-dangerous-beauty-procedure) or have lifelong complications due to surgeries. We “survive” by changing ourselves, making ourselves smaller and more easily digestible, to the point where we look in the mirror and can no longer recognise who is staring back at us. It may seem like survival, but as Dworkin would put it, it is a type of death.

> Not all people feel forced to look a certain type of way in their relationships; but many of us can relate to feeling pressured within these dynamics to keep up with appearances. Love and the pursuit of it (albeit challenging) are supposed to be fun, exhilarating, and life-affirming, but rarely ever feel that way. So, what really makes a good partner? Maybe once we deprioritise the importance of physical appearance from our lives (and gender), we will genuinely know the answer to that question.
