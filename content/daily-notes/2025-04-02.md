#### Means of Production vs Means of Connecting 
[The Algorithmic Holiday - by Brett Scott](https://www.asomo.co/p/the-algorithmic-holiday) #capitalism #gig #economy 

> The Gig Economy platforms, by contrast, run a lean version of this. A company like Uber knows that it doesn’t actually need to own tens of thousands of cars - the Means of Production - provided that it owns an information and management architecture that stands between those productive assets and society: Uber owns the **Means of Connecting**, rather than the Means of Production, which means they can still be a gatekeeper between workers and consumers, while outsourcing finance costs to the individual workers.

#### Choosing Next.js
[Build Times - You should know this before choosing Next.js](https://eduardoboucas.com/posts/2025-03-25-you-should-know-this-before-choosing-nextjs/) #nextjs #next #javascript 

A breakdown of how Next.js seems to be tied to Vercel in many ways, who don't seem to care about being good open source stewards.

- Lack of adapters
- No official serverless support
- Vercel-Specific, Undocumented Code Paths
- Poor Security Incident Handling
- Lack of transparency in governance

#### Beauty and Relationships

> Nobody knows what Leclerc and Mleux’s relationship is like, and yet they assume it’s good because she is beautiful and feminine and adheres to her gender correctly. Conversely, so does he – Leclerc is seen as being good-looking and is immersed in the hyper-masculine and perilous world of motor racing. We praise certain relationships and those within them for their ability to keep up with appearances.

> This is not surprising. As beauty critic, [Jessica DeFino](https://www.dazeddigital.com/beauty/article/62129/1/does-having-bad-morals-really-make-you-ugly-dune-beauty-timothee-chalamet) wrote in her newsletter last year, as a society, we tend to have the moral code of Disney cartoons. We superficially believe that beauty is good; thus, a beautiful couple must have a healthy relationship (look at the contrast with how people talk about and aspire to [Dua Lipa and Callum Turner’s relationship](https://x.com/dreamysoulc/status/1895456432088306106)). When we see people we perceive as “ugly” (ie who sit outside narrow European beauty standards), we are quick to [assume the worst](https://www.dazeddigital.com/beauty/article/62129/1/does-having-bad-morals-really-make-you-ugly-dune-beauty-timothee-chalamet). That their relationship must be bad, that something must be wrong, that they are not really in love. This is exactly why people feel the need to change and transform themselves beyond recognition. It seems contrary to what we ask of people when we are looking for love in the first place. We ask that people genuinely love us for who we are, but the world repeatedly proves that we will only be rewarded for looking a certain way, for not being or looking like ourselves.
