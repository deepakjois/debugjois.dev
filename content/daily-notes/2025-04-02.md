#### Means of Production vs Means of Connecting 
[The Algorithmic Holiday - by Brett Scott](https://www.asomo.co/p/the-algorithmic-holiday) #capitalism #gig #economy 

> The Gig Economy platforms, by contrast, run a lean version of this. A company like Uber knows that it doesn’t actually need to own tens of thousands of cars - the Means of Production - provided that it owns an information and management architecture that stands between those productive assets and society: Uber owns the **Means of Connecting**, rather than the Means of Production, which means they can still be a gatekeeper between workers and consumers, while outsourcing finance costs to the individual workers.
