#### Coffee and aging
[Coffee May Promote Longer, Healthier Living - Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-15/coffee-may-promote-longer-healthier-living?cmpid=BBD071525_prognosis) #caffeine #anti-aging 

> If you're like me, you climb out of bed each morning feeling like a zombie -- until you slug back that first cup of coffee.
> 
> Turns out that morning jolt may benefit more than just energy levels. It could help slow down the aging process of the body's cells, potentially helping to fend off ailments including cancer and neurodegeneration.

> Caffeine flips a biological switch in our bodies called [AMPK](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/aLB2ypqFrTGcToQZc6oJ-hFIZoY6vsLnw-U7cQwe0sZ5xRgq9qTd4fQTYjz6spUpG_NLq9xS8Cum3sCaP2PxQQRGV5BvkP5H36hPK4jvMchAQjzGqC2SYhlwJgSr3uUzPxMch8QgfyhuE_D8nXqJmrVY3_vtuaaEYGSuIjmapWrR28botTBCVUgMzwKCRKqEx0yjYxWF2zyiA8dGZI-WUHotnXCE7X14Wx0PiTTQnn123HqnO4EnR86J84i9xfIZ6Mg5rjiaedkfOTYfuUbYdjB3tu_Bc_QqyoNleVpwdFgvDzPWLYyNCXG8JE1OXdQ76MMrxSofsxxabbEPKkx0qjiPRltPgey1UKyJtkrj6n9bmM3u3lnJvOtPmA/1xsRs7hgE_WWmS2OMNciBKX8Xbnl96qF/10), which monitors our cells' energy levels and, when they're low, tells them to slow down their growth processes and instead focus on repairing damage, according to a [paper](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/2y83L5oqnRzbSUqw_6AjXcOK35B7Kg59rgaqAvzQ0sYU0tbWL8UBzYHMzD8_gO5DkZBFNOSvg-OOJUDz3ViZFjA_LZMD78iSYw2DaJMVCBQYBMQ_Nr5l4qzEi842zikVtDFGJEb59fL17DB7ICVEv5nK8Pop5vG0_AkitN9Zf-PKvtvTBb5Gt_sBS7oO2YVce5XdoJmrK6CEwl6IArtHGLHJF6dF-_tYMLRIHw0u5GKxhX8NbVPSYE2o1Ayl9Aof-mW0OPLmIUS03yR9gDav_w894h_20QANsHKl98XeJOoS8lgk25Bet-Br26F9u66ATgMaRPx5ulfUnqdlnHfAdMzVjajD82YDpqQQ6r3jjGxJhG7YhyhfFRGBXqo/RWNOwWGo9In3w9LyhUdAJqSuuPClKFTk/10) recently published in the journal Microbial Cell.

TOR is highly active when we're embryos and fast-growing kids, helping us develop into adults. Once we're older, it will contribute to our body’s ability to, say, renew skin, grow hair and heal wounds.

> TOR, however, is "pro-aging." When it's too active, it's implicated in problems including metabolic disorders, neurodegeneration, inflammation and cancer, according to Rallis.

> By studying caffeine's effect on cell growth, Rallis is hoping to get a better handle on some of the factors that promote longevity, a field known as biogerontology. That could inform future research into how we can trigger these virtuous cellular effects through diet, lifestyle and new medicines to achieve healthy aging, he said in an interview.
