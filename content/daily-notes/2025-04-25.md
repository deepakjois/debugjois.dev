#### Be a disappointment
[The Imperfectionist: Be a disappointment](https://ckarchive.com/b/5quvh7hnog3mwbp5xxd52a95qqv44in) #burkeman #disappointment 

From Oliver Burkeman's latest:

> The older I get, the more convinced I become that it’s a critical life-skill – at least if you’re roughly the sort of person I am – to **get better at disappointing other people.**
> 
> I don’t just mean you should go easier on yourself when you catch yourself feeling bad for falling short of others’ expectations (although you should do that, too). I mean that it’s worth deliberately and consciously _practicing_ disappointing others, letting the associated feelings sink into your bones, and generally spending time hanging out in the space of ‘being a disappointment’.


> You’re especially likely to benefit if you belong to the category of people psychologists call “insecure overachievers”. (At book festivals and other events, it’s always fun to see people’s eyes widen in recognition when I use that phrase.) That is to say you’re the sort who works hard, gets stuff done, and impresses others with your achievements – but that to some degree, for whatever combination of reasons to do with upbringing, culture or DNA, you do it all because you feel that otherwise you won’t quite have earned your right to exist on the planet.
> 
> Accomplishments that ought to be a source of delight – good grades, promotions, professional success – can feel ironically oppressive to insecure overachievers, because once you’ve met a standard like that, it becomes the new _minimum_ standard you’ve got to meet, next time, in order to carry on feeling adequate.

#### How Y2K Shaped Modern Misogyny

> There were certain words that kept coming up over and over and over again during my research, and ‘empowering’ was one of them. Almost inevitably, whenever it came up, it was being used in a defensive sense, after someone had been critiqued for something. The first [Wonderbra ad with Eva Herzigova](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/eva-herzigova-wonderbra-ad-empowered-women-9875267.html) in 1994 was on billboards everywhere; it was very old-school bombshell, like the death knell for third-wave feminism. But the defence of it was that it was ‘empowering’. She made a lot of money, so maybe it was empowering [_laughs_]. Then there was a movie poster [for 2007 film _Hostel 2_] where a woman was being tortured and confined. It was quite dark, and when there were complaints, one of the producers claimed that they were ‘empowering’, because in the end, she fights back.

> Marketers love nothing more than a good buzzword, right? When they find a word that they can imbue with a certain kind of progressive meaning, that is always a word that you should be suspicious of. Even the word ‘feminism’ is something that is so loaded at this point. But feminism does have a very clear meaning: women should have equal rights to men, and have equal protection under the law.

> **Sophie Gilbert:** A lot of people think of this book as cultural criticism – that’s what I thought it would be, when I was pitching it – but to me, now, it is much more of a history book. And the point of history is not to rehash the stories that people already know; it is to look for the hidden stories that weren’t told at the time.
> 
> History is so often presented through a male frame. These are the stories that weren’t told or weren’t put together at the time, because people don’t really care about women that much, and also people don’t take seriously cultural products that are deemed to be ‘trash’, whether reality TV or gossip magazines or different kinds of media that women enjoy. But at the same time, they have such a massive influence. What I really wanted to do was to look at these, critically and historically, and see what they told me.
