#### Be a disappointment
[The Imperfectionist: Be a disappointment](https://ckarchive.com/b/5quvh7hnog3mwbp5xxd52a95qqv44in) #burkeman #disappointment 

From Oliver Burkeman's latest:

> The older I get, the more convinced I become that it’s a critical life-skill – at least if you’re roughly the sort of person I am – to **get better at disappointing other people.**
> 
> I don’t just mean you should go easier on yourself when you catch yourself feeling bad for falling short of others’ expectations (although you should do that, too). I mean that it’s worth deliberately and consciously _practicing_ disappointing others, letting the associated feelings sink into your bones, and generally spending time hanging out in the space of ‘being a disappointment’.


> You’re especially likely to benefit if you belong to the category of people psychologists call “insecure overachievers”. (At book festivals and other events, it’s always fun to see people’s eyes widen in recognition when I use that phrase.) That is to say you’re the sort who works hard, gets stuff done, and impresses others with your achievements – but that to some degree, for whatever combination of reasons to do with upbringing, culture or DNA, you do it all because you feel that otherwise you won’t quite have earned your right to exist on the planet.
> 
> Accomplishments that ought to be a source of delight – good grades, promotions, professional success – can feel ironically oppressive to insecure overachievers, because once you’ve met a standard like that, it becomes the new _minimum_ standard you’ve got to meet, next time, in order to carry on feeling adequate.
