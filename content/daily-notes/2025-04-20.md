[Alex Bird: "I have found that reviewing code is harder than wâ€¦" - Mastodon Canada](https://mstdn.ca/@alexanderbird/114344077464018360) #llm #code #reviews 

> I have found that reviewing code is harder than writing code. Increasingly, I am trying to write code that is easier to review -- that when someone looks at it, it is easier for them to tell if it does what it ought.

> One of my objections to widespread LLM use for code generation is that we replace the easier task of code writing with the harder task of code reviewing.
