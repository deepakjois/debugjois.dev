#### Marriage Material Shortage
[America’s ‘Marriage Material’ Shortage - The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/02/america-marriage-decline/681518/) #marriage #relationships

> Adults have a way of projecting their anxieties and realities onto their children. In the case of romance, the fixation on young people masks a deeper—and, to me, far more mysterious—phenomenon: What is happening to _adult_ relationships?
> 
> American adults are significantly less likely to be married or to live with a partner than they used to be. The national marriage rate is hovering near its [all-time low](https://archive.is/o/7Azth/https://www.bgsu.edu/ncfmr/resources/data/family-profiles/FP-24-10.html), while the share of women under 65 who aren’t living with a partner has grown steadily since the 1980s. The past decade seems to be the only period since at least the 1970s when women under 35 were more likely to live with their parents than with a spouse.

> People’s lives are diverse, and so are their wants and desires and circumstances. It’s hard, and perhaps impossible, to identify a tiny number of factors that explain hundreds of millions of people’s decisions to couple up, split apart, or remain single. But according to Lyman Stone, a researcher at the Institute for Family Studies, the most important reason marriage and coupling are declining in the U.S. is actually quite straightforward: Many young men are [falling behind](https://archive.is/o/7Azth/https://substack.com/home/post/p-154819917) economically.

> 1. Asymmetric friendships are common. There’s a limit to how asymmetric ongoing romantic relationships can be, because at the end of the day in most marriages you still have to like them enough to live under the same roof. But friendships can be _quite_ asymmetric! Last year a close friend and I were discussing how difficult it can be when one person wants to be supersupersuper close and the other person wants to be… kind of close. That’s not a terrible amount of asymmetry, but it can still feel crushing in the way all unreciprocated love does. Sometimes we really want to be close with someone, and they’re just not available, or not interested. It’s okay to admit that that hurts, even when it’s purely platonic.

#### Cairo's Female Skaters
[Watch: Up close with Cairo’s female skaters | Dazed](https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/66049/1/watch-girls-inX)

Loved watching this (extremely) short film

> The film follows a group of young, female skateboarders, drifters and motorbike riders, aged between 13 and 22, as they careen around the Egyptian capital. The girls are resilient in the face of a traditional, religious and patriarchal society which seeks to prevent them from pursuing their passions; the film follows the group as they overcome the barriers facing them, finding freedom and community in the process.

#### High Agency is Tech's Latest Buzzword
[Why everyone in Silicon Valley wants to be 'high agency'](https://www.usermag.co/i/156511793/techs-hot-new-buzzword) #buzzword #culture

> I love following the evolution of language, and _Business Insider_ [just published a great piece](https://www.businessinsider.com/high-agency-tech-buzzword-silicon-valley-hiring-2025-2) on a new phrase that has taken over Silicon Valley. People in tech used to call themselves "self-starters," then the term "disruptor" came into vogue. Now, everyone is claiming that they’re "high agency."
> 
> From _[Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/high-agency-tech-buzzword-silicon-valley-hiring-2025-2)_:
> 
> > Over the past year, high agency has become _the_ aspirational character trait of Silicon Valley. Early last year, the analytics site Brandwatch found there was a 500% jump in mentions of the phrase across X, Reddit, and other social media sites.
> >
> > Not one but two podcasts titled "High Agency" have launched, one dedicated to AI, the other to entrepreneurship. On LinkedIn, a wide range of sectors, from solar to crypto, are suddenly seeking “high-agency” applicants. And on Substack, tech-culture essayists are schooling readers on how to ratchet up their “high-agency” qualities, which are said to be possessed by tech elites and top athletes.
> > 
> > "High agency" was coined in 2016, when Eric Weinstein, then the managing director of [Peter Thiel's](https://archive.ph/o/NiqqD/https://www.businessinsider.com/peter-thiel) investment firm, referenced it during an appearance on a podcast hosted by the [self-help guru Tim Ferriss](https://archive.ph/o/NiqqD/https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-ferriss-morning-routine-2017-1). In Weinstein's formulation, a high-agency approach to the world is "constantly looking for what is possible, in a kind of MacGyverish sort of a way."
> >
> >It's a trait mostly assigned to [people who start their own companies](https://archive.ph/o/NiqqD/https://www.businessinsider.com/confessions-of-a-startup-founder-wife-marriage-tiktok-games-2023-11), seize opportunities that others miss, and never take "no" for an answer. High-agency people are rich, successful, or on their way to being both. They're action-oriented and find opportunities where others see roadblocks.
> 
> As the article explains, Americans love phrases and terms that are meant to inspire future hard-working business leaders. Words like grit, type A, and even girlboss all connote an intense drive. The phrase “high agency” grates me a bit though. It sounds hyper-individualistic and implies a sort of pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps type mentality. The reality of life in America is that it doesn’t matter how “high agency” you are, you could end up in medical debt and lose your house, or become permanently disabled overnight from catching a virus someone gave to you on the bus to work.
> 
> Silicon Valley billionaires like Marc Andreessen talk about “high agency” people as if they’re some superior class and the traits they carry are innate, which reads a bit weird to me considering how fond those people are of eugenics. That said, the phrase does seem to be getting mainstreamed enough already that it won’t carry those connotations for very long. It is already being fully adopted into the hustle-bro lexicon.

#### Git - template for commit messages
[Conventional Commits | Mike Perham](https://www.mikeperham.com/2025/01/30/conventional-commits) #git #template #commit #tools

git supports a template for commit messages and any lines that start with `#` are ignored. I added this as `~/.gitmessage`:

```
# type(subsystem): short description
### Types
# feat: A new feature
# fix: A bug fix
# docs: Documentation only changes
# build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
# ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
# perf: A code change that improves performance
# refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
# style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
# test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
```

and then adjusted `~/.gitconfig` like this:

```
[commit]
  template = ~/.gitmessage
```

#### What to read
[everything i read in january 2025 - by Celine Nguyen](https://www.personalcanon.com/p/everything-i-read-in-january-2025)

> When people ask me, ‘What kinds of books do you read?’ I never know what to say. I suspect I’m not alone in this. Obviously, people tend to prefer certain books, films, songs—but I don’t know how many people will say that they _just_ read sci-fi, _only_ watch noirs, prefer hyperpop above all else.[1](https://www.personalcanon.com/p/everything-i-read-in-january-2025#footnote-1-156517979) The best descriptions end up feeling very specific and very vague: Books about fatally flawed people who keep on going. Films about crushing on someone in a decadent setting. Music that feels pure and shot through with light.
> 
> My philosophy on reading can be summed up as: _Don’t discriminate, but be discerning_. I’d hate to dismiss a book for the wrong reasons—but I _do_ want to feel opinionated about what I’m reading.

#### Suspectibility to Misinformation
[Educated but easily fooled? Who falls for misinformation and why](https://nachrichten.idw-online.de/2025/02/05/educated-but-easily-fooled-who-falls-for-misinformation-and-why) #misinformation

> Political identity also played a key role. The meta-analysis confirmed previous research showing that individuals who identify as Republicans are more likely to fall for misinformation than those who identify as Democrats. Republicans were less accurate at assessing the veracity of news and tended to label more headlines as true, whereas Democrats were more skeptical. Individuals with higher analytical thinking skills—that is, who are better at logically evaluating information, identifying patterns, and systematically solving problems—performed better overall and were more skeptical (tending to classify news as false). People were more likely to believe that news that aligned with their political identity was true and to disregard news that was not aligned with their political identity—a phenomenon known as partisan bias. However, a counterintuitive finding was that individuals with higher analytical thinking were actually more susceptible to partisan bias. This tendency is known as motivated reflection, which is a cognitive process where individuals' analytical reasoning works against them to protect their pre-existing beliefs, values, or partisan affiliations. The strongest effect in the meta-analysis was the influence of familiarity. When participants reported having already seen a news headline, they were more likely to believe it was true. This finding underscores the danger of repeated exposure to misinformation, particularly on social media.

> “The results highlight the urgent need to integrate media literacy and critical thinking skills into school curricula from an early age. Younger adults, despite being considered 'digital natives,' were less able to distinguish between true and false news,” Ralf Kurvers continues. More effective and age-appropriate media literacy programs tailored to this group are therefore crucial. Furthermore, given the strong effects of familiarity and political bias, interventions for helping people identify and share less misinformation must consider how information is presented and shared, especially on social media, where these effects are amplified. For example, effective interventions might emphasize commonalities and promote dialogue across political boundaries.
