#### Marriage Material Shortage
[America’s ‘Marriage Material’ Shortage - The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/02/america-marriage-decline/681518/) #marriage #relationships

> Adults have a way of projecting their anxieties and realities onto their children. In the case of romance, the fixation on young people masks a deeper—and, to me, far more mysterious—phenomenon: What is happening to _adult_ relationships?
> 
> American adults are significantly less likely to be married or to live with a partner than they used to be. The national marriage rate is hovering near its [all-time low](https://archive.is/o/7Azth/https://www.bgsu.edu/ncfmr/resources/data/family-profiles/FP-24-10.html), while the share of women under 65 who aren’t living with a partner has grown steadily since the 1980s. The past decade seems to be the only period since at least the 1970s when women under 35 were more likely to live with their parents than with a spouse.

> People’s lives are diverse, and so are their wants and desires and circumstances. It’s hard, and perhaps impossible, to identify a tiny number of factors that explain hundreds of millions of people’s decisions to couple up, split apart, or remain single. But according to Lyman Stone, a researcher at the Institute for Family Studies, the most important reason marriage and coupling are declining in the U.S. is actually quite straightforward: Many young men are [falling behind](https://archive.is/o/7Azth/https://substack.com/home/post/p-154819917) economically.

> 1. Asymmetric friendships are common. There’s a limit to how asymmetric ongoing romantic relationships can be, because at the end of the day in most marriages you still have to like them enough to live under the same roof. But friendships can be _quite_ asymmetric! Last year a close friend and I were discussing how difficult it can be when one person wants to be supersupersuper close and the other person wants to be… kind of close. That’s not a terrible amount of asymmetry, but it can still feel crushing in the way all unreciprocated love does. Sometimes we really want to be close with someone, and they’re just not available, or not interested. It’s okay to admit that that hurts, even when it’s purely platonic.

#### Cairo's Female Skaters
[Watch: Up close with Cairo’s female skaters | Dazed](https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/66049/1/watch-girls-inX)

Loved watching this (extremely) short film

> The film follows a group of young, female skateboarders, drifters and motorbike riders, aged between 13 and 22, as they careen around the Egyptian capital. The girls are resilient in the face of a traditional, religious and patriarchal society which seeks to prevent them from pursuing their passions; the film follows the group as they overcome the barriers facing them, finding freedom and community in the process.

#### High Agency is Tech's Latest Buzzword
[Why everyone in Silicon Valley wants to be 'high agency'](https://www.usermag.co/i/156511793/techs-hot-new-buzzword) #buzzword #culture

> I love following the evolution of language, and _Business Insider_ [just published a great piece](https://www.businessinsider.com/high-agency-tech-buzzword-silicon-valley-hiring-2025-2) on a new phrase that has taken over Silicon Valley. People in tech used to call themselves "self-starters," then the term "disruptor" came into vogue. Now, everyone is claiming that they’re "high agency."
> 
> From _[Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/high-agency-tech-buzzword-silicon-valley-hiring-2025-2)_:
> 
> > Over the past year, high agency has become _the_ aspirational character trait of Silicon Valley. Early last year, the analytics site Brandwatch found there was a 500% jump in mentions of the phrase across X, Reddit, and other social media sites.
> >
> > Not one but two podcasts titled "High Agency" have launched, one dedicated to AI, the other to entrepreneurship. On LinkedIn, a wide range of sectors, from solar to crypto, are suddenly seeking “high-agency” applicants. And on Substack, tech-culture essayists are schooling readers on how to ratchet up their “high-agency” qualities, which are said to be possessed by tech elites and top athletes.
> > 
> > "High agency" was coined in 2016, when Eric Weinstein, then the managing director of [Peter Thiel's](https://archive.ph/o/NiqqD/https://www.businessinsider.com/peter-thiel) investment firm, referenced it during an appearance on a podcast hosted by the [self-help guru Tim Ferriss](https://archive.ph/o/NiqqD/https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-ferriss-morning-routine-2017-1). In Weinstein's formulation, a high-agency approach to the world is "constantly looking for what is possible, in a kind of MacGyverish sort of a way."
> >
> >It's a trait mostly assigned to [people who start their own companies](https://archive.ph/o/NiqqD/https://www.businessinsider.com/confessions-of-a-startup-founder-wife-marriage-tiktok-games-2023-11), seize opportunities that others miss, and never take "no" for an answer. High-agency people are rich, successful, or on their way to being both. They're action-oriented and find opportunities where others see roadblocks.
> 
> As the article explains, Americans love phrases and terms that are meant to inspire future hard-working business leaders. Words like grit, type A, and even girlboss all connote an intense drive. The phrase “high agency” grates me a bit though. It sounds hyper-individualistic and implies a sort of pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps type mentality. The reality of life in America is that it doesn’t matter how “high agency” you are, you could end up in medical debt and lose your house, or become permanently disabled overnight from catching a virus someone gave to you on the bus to work.
> 
> Silicon Valley billionaires like Marc Andreessen talk about “high agency” people as if they’re some superior class and the traits they carry are innate, which reads a bit weird to me considering how fond those people are of eugenics. That said, the phrase does seem to be getting mainstreamed enough already that it won’t carry those connotations for very long. It is already being fully adopted into the hustle-bro lexicon.
