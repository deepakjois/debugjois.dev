#### How GenZ sees the world
[Gen Z and the End of Predictable Progress - by kyla scanlon](https://substack.com/inbox/post/157018533) #genz #economics #demography 

Great piece by Kyla Scanlon that is worth reading in full. All the links to other articles she has written related to this topic are worth following as well. This post does a great job of providing a broad persuasive sweep of how GenZ are seeing the world.

> **Key Takeaways:**
> 
> - Gen Z faces a double disruption: AI-driven technological change and institutional instability
> - Three distinct Gen Z cohorts have emerged, each with different relationships to digital reality
> - A version of the barbell strategy is splitting career paths between "safety seekers" and "digital gamblers"
> - Our fiscal reality is quite stark right now, and that is shaping how young people see opportunities

> But young people are facing a double disruption - (1) technological creative destruction in the form of AI combined with (some form of) political creative destruction in the form of the Trump administration. When I talk to young people from New York or Louisiana or Tennessee or California or DC or Indiana or Massachusetts about their futures, they're not just worried about finding jobs, they're worried about whether or not the whole concept of a "career" as we know it will exist in five years. So in this piece, I want to talk about:

#### Paradox of Abundance
[Paradox of Abundance: Automation Anxiety Returns](https://academic.oup.com/book/9606/chapter-abstract/156660852?redirectedFrom=fulltext)

> Despite sustained increases in material standards of living, fear of the adverse employment consequences of technological advancement has recurred repeatedly. This represents a paradox of abundance: technological change threatens social welfare not because it intensifies scarcity but because it augments abundance. For most citizens of market economies, the primary income-generating asset they possess is their scarce labor. If rapid technological advances were to effectively substitute cheap and abundant capital for (previously) expensive and willful labor, society would be made wealthier, not poorer, in aggregate, but those who own labor but do not own capital might find it increasingly challenging to make a living. This chapter considers why automation anxiety has suddenly become salient in popular and academic discourse. It offers informed conjectures on the potential implications of these developments for employment and earnings.
