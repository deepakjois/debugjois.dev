[Why female pop stars are lambasting mediocre men](https://www.economist.com/culture/2025/09/08/why-female-pop-stars-are-lambasting-mediocre-men?giftId=0737d9cc-f56d-4b5f-aa03-b4e3a5617f70&utm_campaign=gifted_article) #gender #relationships 

Men are pushing back it seems 😂

> Yet this current wave of songs reflects a social shift. Women in the rich world are enjoying more economic power, meaning they [can be choosier](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2016/04/16/why-put-a-ring-on-it) about their partners. Many are willing to hold out for someone who will do the washing up and put the toilet seat down. According to Pew Research Centre, 35% of American women between the ages of 25 and 54 were single in 2023, up from 29% in 1990. Across many measures, from education to politics, young men and women are [drifting apart](https://www.economist.com/international/2024/03/13/why-the-growing-gulf-between-young-men-and-women). Nearly 60% of American university graduates are women. Given that most women prefer not to date or marry down, for many it can be, as Ms Carpenter says, slim pickings.

> Men are pushing back, at least musically. In August the top album on the _Billboard_ 200 chart was “I’m the Problem” by [Morgan Wallen](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/09/01/thanks-to-morgan-wallen-country-musics-popularity-has-surged), an American country singer. “If I’m so awful,” he sings, “then why’d you stick around this long?”

#### Hangovers
[Do hangover supplements work?](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2025/09/05/do-hangover-supplements-work) #alcohol 

> Hangovers are complicated. Some symptoms, including fatigue, are brought on by the negative effects alcohol has on sleep. Others, such as headaches and dry mouths, are made worse by the dehydration that results from alcohol’s suppression of vasopressin, a hormone that regulates kidney function.
>
> But many of the more severe consequences are caused by the toxic effects of the drink itself. Whether you imbibe grape or grain, aged or fresh, neat or mixed, you will mainly experience the intoxication of ethanol. And although the human body is capable of metabolising the stuff, it does so in a slow and uncomfortable manner. First, an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) breaks down the compound into acetaldehyde, which can dilate blood vessels in the head, producing headaches, and irritate the lining of the stomach, leading to nausea. These pass when another enzyme, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), in turn breaks down acetaldehyde into less harmful chemicals.

> Most hangover supplements, therefore, claim to help ADH and ALDH do their jobs a little faster.
