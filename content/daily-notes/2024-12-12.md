#### Meditations for Mortals Day Seventeen


> Many of us believe we ought to be kinder or more generous, to give more money to charity, spend more time volunteering, or in some vaguer way ‘become a better person’ than we currently are. The Tibetan Buddhist master Chögyam Trungpa’s point is that this isn’t necessary: you needn’t try to transform yourself into someone who feels more love for humanity, and it’s probably impossible anyway. You just need to find where you already feel warmth or tenderness, then go from there. And your penchant for Mexican food is as good a place to start as any other.
