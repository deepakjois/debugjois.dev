#### The Abstraction Ceiling
Justing Skycak from Math Academy has a great thread on large differences at the tail end of exponential distributions. This for e.g leads to vast differences in talent between 99th & 99.9th percentile, which is larger than the difference between 50th & 90th percentiles. #talent #competition #abstraction

#### Why Are We Distracted
[Why You Can't Focus - 5 Mistakes Keeping You Distracted - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjQ4ZPOCYEI) #distractions

Cal Newport's newest podcast covers five reasons why folks are distracted

- **Using Your Phone as a Stress Reliever:** Many people reflexively turn to their phones to cope with stress or boredom, reinforcing a habit loop that fragments attention.
- **Playing "Obligation Hot Potato" at Work:** Many workers handle incoming messages and emails by deflecting them as quickly as possible rather than resolving them, creating a cycle of continuous distraction.
- **Doing Too Many Things at the Same Time:** Multitasking leads to an “overhead tax” where too much time is spent managing logistics rather than accomplishing deep work.
- **Being Disorganized:** Lack of structured planning forces people into reactive, last-minute decision-making, leading to stress and distraction.
- **Lacking Foundational Pursuits:** Without long-term, meaningful activities, people default to distractions.

**Actionable Takeaways:**
✅ Replace phone scrolling with higher-quality stress relief activities.  
✅ Write more thoughtful responses to emails to reduce unnecessary follow-ups.  
✅ Reduce the number of concurrent projects to minimize cognitive overhead.  
✅ Use structured systems like status boards and weekly planning to stay organized.  
✅ Develop meaningful long-term pursuits both at work and outside of it.
