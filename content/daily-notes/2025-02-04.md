#### The Abstraction Ceiling
Justing Skycak from Math Academy has a great thread on large differences at the tail end of exponential distributions. This for e.g leads to vast differences in talent between 99th & 99.9th percentile, which is larger than the difference between 50th & 90th percentiles. #talent #competition #abstraction

#### Why Are We Distracted
[Why You Can't Focus - 5 Mistakes Keeping You Distracted - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjQ4ZPOCYEI) #distractions

Cal Newport's newest podcast covers five reasons why folks are distracted

- **Using Your Phone as a Stress Reliever:** Many people reflexively turn to their phones to cope with stress or boredom, reinforcing a habit loop that fragments attention.
- **Playing "Obligation Hot Potato" at Work:** Many workers handle incoming messages and emails by deflecting them as quickly as possible rather than resolving them, creating a cycle of continuous distraction.
- **Doing Too Many Things at the Same Time:** Multitasking leads to an “overhead tax” where too much time is spent managing logistics rather than accomplishing deep work.
- **Being Disorganized:** Lack of structured planning forces people into reactive, last-minute decision-making, leading to stress and distraction.
- **Lacking Foundational Pursuits:** Without long-term, meaningful activities, people default to distractions.

**Actionable Takeaways:**
✅ Replace phone scrolling with higher-quality stress relief activities.  
✅ Write more thoughtful responses to emails to reduce unnecessary follow-ups.  
✅ Reduce the number of concurrent projects to minimize cognitive overhead.  
✅ Use structured systems like status boards and weekly planning to stay organized.  
✅ Develop meaningful long-term pursuits both at work and outside of it.

#### NYT Amplifier: Grammy Nominees
[Meet the Grammys’ Best New Artist Nominees - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/arts/music/amplifier-newsletter-grammys-best-new-artist.html) #playlists #nyt #amplifier

> Each year, just before the Grammys, I like to create a playlist that introduces listeners to the nominees for best new artist. And since this year’s ceremony is on Sunday, it’s time.
> 
> If you’ve been paying attention to popular music at all in the past year or so, quite a few of these names need no introduction. **Sabrina Carpenter** scored not one but three massive hits last year, all of them animated by her perky, quirky charisma. **Shaboozey**’s downcast foot-stomper “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” was so ubiquitous, it tied the record for most weeks spent atop the Billboard Hot 100 (19 — that’s over a third of a year!). The soulful vocalists **Teddy Swims** and **Benson Boone** both had breakout hits that propelled them into the mainstream ([“Lose Control”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LweyzRnEzOE) and [“Beautiful Things”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa_RSwwpPaA)).
> 
> In a different kind of year, any of those artists could have easily been the front-runner for the best new artist trophy. But in this contest, they’re going up against the red-hot, pop-cultural supernova that is **Chappell Roan**. As she says: Good luck, babe!

#### Stablecoins and Product-Market Fit
Looks like the powers that be are pushing this narrative or "Stablecoins have Product Market Fit" very hard. I heard it on the a16z podcast a while ago, and now Techcrunch has an article on it. Almost makes me suspect it's a paid placement of some kind.
