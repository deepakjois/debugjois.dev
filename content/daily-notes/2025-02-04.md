#### The Abstraction Ceiling
Justing Skycak from Math Academy has a great thread on large differences at the tail end of exponential distributions. This for e.g leads to vast differences in talent between 99th & 99.9th percentile, which is larger than the difference between 50th & 90th percentiles. #talent #competition #abstraction

#### Why Are We Distracted
[Why You Can't Focus - 5 Mistakes Keeping You Distracted - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjQ4ZPOCYEI) #distractions

Cal Newport's newest podcast covers five reasons why folks are distracted

- **Using Your Phone as a Stress Reliever:** Many people reflexively turn to their phones to cope with stress or boredom, reinforcing a habit loop that fragments attention.
- **Playing "Obligation Hot Potato" at Work:** Many workers handle incoming messages and emails by deflecting them as quickly as possible rather than resolving them, creating a cycle of continuous distraction.
- **Doing Too Many Things at the Same Time:** Multitasking leads to an “overhead tax” where too much time is spent managing logistics rather than accomplishing deep work.
- **Being Disorganized:** Lack of structured planning forces people into reactive, last-minute decision-making, leading to stress and distraction.
- **Lacking Foundational Pursuits:** Without long-term, meaningful activities, people default to distractions.

**Actionable Takeaways:**
✅ Replace phone scrolling with higher-quality stress relief activities.  
✅ Write more thoughtful responses to emails to reduce unnecessary follow-ups.  
✅ Reduce the number of concurrent projects to minimize cognitive overhead.  
✅ Use structured systems like status boards and weekly planning to stay organized.  
✅ Develop meaningful long-term pursuits both at work and outside of it.

#### NYT Amplifier: Grammy Nominees
[Meet the Grammys’ Best New Artist Nominees - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/arts/music/amplifier-newsletter-grammys-best-new-artist.html) #playlists #nyt #amplifier

> Each year, just before the Grammys, I like to create a playlist that introduces listeners to the nominees for best new artist. And since this year’s ceremony is on Sunday, it’s time.
> 
> If you’ve been paying attention to popular music at all in the past year or so, quite a few of these names need no introduction. **Sabrina Carpenter** scored not one but three massive hits last year, all of them animated by her perky, quirky charisma. **Shaboozey**’s downcast foot-stomper “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” was so ubiquitous, it tied the record for most weeks spent atop the Billboard Hot 100 (19 — that’s over a third of a year!). The soulful vocalists **Teddy Swims** and **Benson Boone** both had breakout hits that propelled them into the mainstream ([“Lose Control”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LweyzRnEzOE) and [“Beautiful Things”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa_RSwwpPaA)).
> 
> In a different kind of year, any of those artists could have easily been the front-runner for the best new artist trophy. But in this contest, they’re going up against the red-hot, pop-cultural supernova that is **Chappell Roan**. As she says: Good luck, babe!

#### Stablecoins and Product-Market Fit
Looks like the powers that be are pushing this narrative or "Stablecoins have Product Market Fit" very hard. I heard it on the a16z podcast a while ago, and now Techcrunch has an article on it. Almost makes me suspect it's a paid placement of some kind. Nevertheless, I found some of the use cases compelling.

[Stablecoins are finding product-market fit in emerging markets | TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/31/stablecoins-are-finding-product-market-fit-in-emerging-markets) #stablecoin #crypto 

> To bypass these challenges, SpaceX [turned to stablecoins](https://cryptoslate.com/elon-musks-spacex-uses-stablecoins-to-hedge-against-foreign-exchange-risks/), a fast-growing method for cross-border payments already widely used in emerging markets. The company [partnered with Bridge](https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/08/29/bridge-stablecoins-sequoia-ribbit-index-haun-58-million/), a stablecoin payments platform, to accept payments in various currencies and instantly convert them into stablecoins for its global treasury.
>
> This move positioned Bridge as a viable alternative to correspondent banks in markets where traditional financial systems fall short. Soon after, [Stripe took notice](https://x.com/arrington/status/1848060479727435967), acquiring the startup for more than $1 billion and solidifying Bridge’s reputation and driving up its valuation as an infrastructure player, solving inefficiencies in global finance.

> The rise of stablecoins — now a [$205 billion market](https://www.bitget.com/news/detail/12560604457144) — is driven by real-world utility, not speculation, particularly in emerging markets where the most compelling use cases unfold. Cross-border payments in these regions are typically slow and expensive, involving multiple intermediaries. For example, a textile manufacturer in Brazil paying a supplier in Nigeria might have to go through several banks and currency exchanges, each adding fees and delays. Stablecoins remove this friction, enabling cheaper, near-instant transactions.

Africa:

> [Yellow Card](https://yellowcard.io/), which provides a platform that lets users convert fiat to crypto and back to fiat, doubled its annual transaction volume to $3 billion in 2024 from $1.5 billion in 2023. [Conduit](https://conduitpay.com/), which enables stablecoin payments for import-export businesses in Africa and Latin America, saw its annualized TPV jump to $10 billion from $5 billion. Lagos-based [Juicyway](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/16/this-stealthy-african-stablecoin-startup-already-processed-over-1b-in-cross-border-payments/), which facilitates cross-border payments using stablecoins, has processed $1.3 billion in total payment volume to date.

> Beyond consumer savings, stablecoins are reshaping global payroll. As remote work expands, startups like Rise allow companies to pay contractors using stablecoins. The platform lets businesses pay in fiat while contractors receive stablecoins like USDC or USDT, avoiding currency volatility. Last November, Rise [raised $6.3 million in Series A](https://www.axios.com/pro/fintech-deals/2024/11/20/stablecoin-payroll-startup-rise-6-million), fueling its expansion in stablecoin-powered payroll solutions.

> This January, Brazilian unicorn Nubank [introduced a feature rewarding USDC holders](https://international.nubank.com.br/consumers/nubank-expands-usdc-rewards-program-to-all-customers/) with a 4% annual return, following a tenfold increase in customer-held USDC last year. Now, 30% of Nubank’s users have USDC in their portfolios. Nubank joins other fintech giants like Venmo, Apple Pay, PayPal, Cash App, and Revolut, which already enable in-app stablecoin transactions.
