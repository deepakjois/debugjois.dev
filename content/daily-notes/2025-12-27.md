#### AI and Programming - Hot Takes by Karpathy and Cherny
Andrej Karpathy broke AI Twitter the day after Christmas by tweeting that _“never felt this much behind as a programmer.”_

Boris Cherny, creator of Claude Code piled on to say - _“I feel this way most weeks tbh.”_ and went on - _“The last month was my first month as an engineer that I didn’t open an IDE at all. Opus 4.5 wrote around 200 PRs, every single line. Software engineering is radically changing, and the hardest part even for early adopters and practitioners like us is to continue to re-adjust our expectations. And this is *still* just the beginning.”_

The one redeeming thing about Boris Cherny's tweet was that it kicked off a thread where he gave out a lot of very specific tips in the thread on how the Claude Code team uses Claude Code to write code. Folks might miss it because it branches off the main thread from Karpathy. But there is some absolute gold stuff in there.

I had a bout of insomnia last night (for reasons unrelated to AI taking my job, I will add!) when I came across these tweets. I managed to get off my bed and opened Claude Code to hack on my side project, but mainly it was an excuse to try out some of the tips and techniques mentioned in the thread. I guess the hustle is real! 🙃
