#### Your reality is someone else's content
[your reality is someone's content - by Adam Aleksic](https://etymology.substack.com/p/your-reality-is-someones-content)

> I’ve [written before](https://etymology.substack.com/p/against-content) about how there are two types of communication: the _ritual_ kind, meant for connecting with other human beings, and the _transmission_ kind, optimizing for distribution of information. Every new technology since the telegraph has continued to prioritize transmission at the expense of ritual. All that matters is how much you can communicate, to how many people—everything is done for views.

But ritual is [what gives life meaning](https://etymology.substack.com/p/social-media-and-the-collapse-of). There’s a reason it feels better to talk with a friend on a picnic blanket than watch your friend’s TikToks for the same length of time. Either way, you’re getting the same amount of information about your friend, but only the picnic feels special.
