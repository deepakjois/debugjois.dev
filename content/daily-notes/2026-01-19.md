> I’ve [written before](https://etymology.substack.com/p/against-content) about how there are two types of communication: the _ritual_ kind, meant for connecting with other human beings, and the _transmission_ kind, optimizing for distribution of information. Every new technology since the telegraph has continued to prioritize transmission at the expense of ritual. All that matters is how much you can communicate, to how many people—everything is done for views.

> But ritual is [what gives life meaning](https://etymology.substack.com/p/social-media-and-the-collapse-of). There’s a reason it feels better to talk with a friend on a picnic blanket than watch your friend’s TikToks for the same length of time. Either way, you’re getting the same amount of information about your friend, but only the picnic feels special.

> These are only the most obvious examples. I think the viral [Sydney Sweeney ad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Eagle_Outfitters#Sydney_Sweeney_ad_campaign) last summer was another example of clip farming, just less on the nose. The real advertisement wasn’t the weird genetics joke, but the subsequent discourse _around_ the advertisement. The purpose of the campaign was to make people uncomfortable enough to talk about it online, and now American Eagle stock is up 100%.

> The more we rely on the transmission view of communication, the less incentive there is to treat other people with care. Companies like [Cluely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluely) can raise millions of dollars by promoting academic dishonesty, and crypto scammers can inflate the value of their shitcoins by [popularizing racist memes](https://www.ft.com/content/ced371e2-a326-4ff8-b979-20a77c21d9de). If the point is distribution above connection, it’s okay to hurt other people as long as your message gets across.
