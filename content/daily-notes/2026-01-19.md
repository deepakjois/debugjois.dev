#### Your reality is someone else's content
[your reality is someone's content - by Adam Aleksic](https://etymology.substack.com/p/your-reality-is-someones-content) #culture #communication #social-media 

> I’ve [written before](https://etymology.substack.com/p/against-content) about how there are two types of communication: the _ritual_ kind, meant for connecting with other human beings, and the _transmission_ kind, optimizing for distribution of information. Every new technology since the telegraph has continued to prioritize transmission at the expense of ritual. All that matters is how much you can communicate, to how many people—everything is done for views.
> 
> But ritual is [what gives life meaning](https://etymology.substack.com/p/social-media-and-the-collapse-of). There’s a reason it feels better to talk with a friend on a picnic blanket than watch your friend’s TikToks for the same length of time. Either way, you’re getting the same amount of information about your friend, but only the picnic feels special.

> These are only the most obvious examples. I think the viral [Sydney Sweeney ad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Eagle_Outfitters#Sydney_Sweeney_ad_campaign) last summer was another example of clip farming, just less on the nose. The real advertisement wasn’t the weird genetics joke, but the subsequent discourse _around_ the advertisement. The purpose of the campaign was to make people uncomfortable enough to talk about it online, and now American Eagle stock is up 100%.
> 
> The more we rely on the transmission view of communication, the less incentive there is to treat other people with care. Companies like [Cluely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluely) can raise millions of dollars by promoting academic dishonesty, and crypto scammers can inflate the value of their shitcoins by [popularizing racist memes](https://www.ft.com/content/ced371e2-a326-4ff8-b979-20a77c21d9de). If the point is distribution above connection, it’s okay to hurt other people as long as your message gets across.

#### Friction was the feature
[Friction Was the Feature - John Stone's Blog](https://johnstone.substack.com/p/friction-was-the-feature) #ai #slop 

> Today, a candidate armed with an LLM can parse dozens of job postings, lift phrasing from each, and generate a set of keyword-optimized cover letters in no time. They can auto-tailor their resume to each posting. They can submit 30 applications in one sitting.
> 
> This is better, right?
> 
> Not for anyone, actually. Applications soar; recruiters drown. So we bolt on more automation: applicant tracking systems, resume parsers, AI interview schedulers. We convince ourselves we’ve built a better machine, but we haven’t redesigned the only machine that matters: the system matching the right people to the right work.

> We automated the production of artifacts but haven’t fixed judgment. The result is a marketplace of immaculate verbiage with very little meaning, of noise without signal.
> 
> Everyone looks more “efficient.” Very little about it feels effective.
> 
> Recruiting is just one place where friction used to be the feature. When the marginal cost of creating words falls toward zero, any system that uses those words as a proxy for quality begins to fail.
