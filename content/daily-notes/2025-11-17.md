#### Summary of Four Thousand Weeks
[Four Thousand Weeks](https://www.reza.so/bookshelf/four-thousand-weeks) #burkeman #books 

Oliver Burkeman's Four Thousand Weeks is one of the most influential books I have read in the last few months. 

- Productivity is a trap: total control and work-life balance are illusions.
-  Embrace your finite life instead of fighting it: accept missing out and find meaning in choices.
-  Learn to be a good procrastinator: consciously delay distractions and focus on top priorities.
-  The efficiency trap and convenience culture: increased efficiency leads to more demands; choose what matters.
-  Attention is your real life: treat attention as sacred and resist distraction.
-  Radical incrementalism and “stay on the bus”: make meaningful work a small, sustainable daily habit.
-  Cosmic insignificance therapy: accept you won’t change the universe and find meaning in ordinary acts.
-  Do the next most necessary thing: focus on the immediate next step without a perfect plan.
