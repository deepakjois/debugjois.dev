#### NYT Amplifier Playlist
The new NYT Amplifier playlist just landed and I have been listening to it: [The Amplifier: 7 New Songs You Should Hear Now](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu_RmAJBNiIKX01JatOKPfJcqryAiwN9X&si=44jh91xURPnUFev4)

_Graucha Max_ by Darkside might be one of my favs.

#### Walking in Japan
[Walking Japan (again): From Fukuoka to Nagasaki](https://walkingtheworld.substack.com/p/walking-japan-again-from-fukuoka)

Yet another lovely read from Chris Arnade. Yet another antidote to the Japan slop hitting my timeline from folks visiting there from India, and just marking off places they found in a tourist guide.

> Work as the central point of your life can sound empty and meaningless and not something you think I would admire given that I write about needing something spiritual that isnâ€™t confined to this world, but also tries to make sense of what comes after death. Yet when you are a stakeholder in your job, that is when you are your own boss, which is one of the defining differences between craftsmanship and simple labor, then there can be a spiritual component, which while not as deep and complex as faith, can give someone a clear sense of purpose that extends beyond this life.

> In Japan, partly due to permissive zoning laws, but also because of historical precedent, there are independently owned and run restaurants almost everywhere, although they tend to cluster next to train stations, which are also almost everywhere. These small businesses are the economic and meaning-making engine for almost everyone who works in them, which is often both parents, and a few of their children. That sense of ownership, coupled with a culture of thoughtfulness, means the food in them is almost always amazing, no matter the location.
