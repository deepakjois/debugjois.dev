#### NYT Amplifier Playlist
The new NYT Amplifier playlist just landed and I have been listening to it: [The Amplifier: 7 New Songs You Should Hear Now](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu_RmAJBNiIKX01JatOKPfJcqryAiwN9X&si=44jh91xURPnUFev4)

_Graucha Max_ by Darkside might be one of my favs.

#### Walking in Japan
[Walking Japan (again): From Fukuoka to Nagasaki](https://walkingtheworld.substack.com/p/walking-japan-again-from-fukuoka)

Lovely read from Chris Arn. Yet another antidote to the Japan slop hitting my timeline from folks visiting there from India, and just marking off places they found in a tourist guide.

> In Japan, partly due to permissive zoning laws, but also because of historical precedent, there are independently owned and run restaurants almost everywhere, although they tend to cluster next to train stations, which are also almost everywhere[5](https://walkingtheworld.substack.com/p/walking-japan-again-from-fukuoka#footnote-5-151473042). These small businesses are the economic and meaning-making engine for almost everyone who works in them, which is often both parents, and a few of their children. That sense of ownership, coupled with a culture of thoughtfulness, means the food in them is almost always amazing, no matter the location.
