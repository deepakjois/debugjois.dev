#### Is our obsession with skincare becoming a disorder?
[Dermorexia: Is our obsession with skincare becoming a disorder? | Dazed](https://www.dazeddigital.com/beauty/article/65829/1/dermorexia-is-our-obsession-with-skincare-becoming-a-disorder) #skincare #beauty 

I tried to make a general point about skincare on X recently and got pulled into a [bit of an argument](https://x.com/debugjois/status/1859830719834619941) without me having any part in initiating it. I normally don't engage in long debates over X because I find it unproductive, so I extricated myself pretty quickly. 

This article makes many points I wanted to make in a very articulate manner.

> While beauty has always been prized, recently it seems like culture has become more visual, shallow and individualistic. Today we are [seeing our own faces more](https://www.dazeddigital.com/beauty/article/60860/1/we-were-never-supposed-to-see-our-faces-this-much-social-media-zoom) than ever before. This, combined with increasingly advanced and accessible technology (digital and surgical) and a [heightened fear of ageing](https://www.dazeddigital.com/beauty/article/61517/1/ageing-botox-and-the-end-of-the-world-tiktok-filters-wrinkles), has created an environment where people have developed an [obsessive preoccupation with “glowing up”](https://www.dazeddigital.com/beauty/article/64573/1/the-makeover-trap-how-we-get-addicted-to-the-glow-up) and the elaborate skincare routines that promise to achieve it. But as [13-year-old girls start seeking Botox](https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/mar/25/teenagers-botox-cosmetic-surgeons-concerned-yomi-adegoke) and [people are going into debt](https://www.dazeddigital.com/beauty/article/56545/1/the-price-of-beauty-debt-crisis-pay-for-cosmetic-treatments-botox-filler) to afford their treatments, is this preoccupation veering into disordered territory?  
> 
> Jessica DeFino, beauty researcher, writer, and critic of [The Review of Beauty](https://jessicadefino.substack.com/), believes so. Last year, she coined a new term to describe the obsessive behaviours that we are starting to see around skincare regimens: “[dermorexia](https://jessicadefino.substack.com/p/dermorexia-compulsive-skincare-obsession?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=43028&post_id=140807627&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=nksc&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email)”. As she defines it, dermorexia is a fixation on skincare and reaching an aesthetic goal that becomes harmful, negatively affecting the health of our skin as well as our mental health.
> 
> The beauty industry has always sold us the idea that the aesthetic of our skin is synonymous with skin health, with “clear”, poreless, glassy skin being seen as good, rather than skin that functions effectively. “Skin serves a huge purpose beyond aesthetic purposes,” DeFino tells Dazed. “The aesthetic goal of perpetually youthful, poreless skin with no texture or pigmentation is not a health goal.” 
> 
> Trying to reach that goal is often detrimental, as it can impair the skin barrier and disrupt the skin microbiome. Excessive product use and harsh ingredients can cause inflammatory conditions like acne, psoriasis, rosacea, eczema and dermatitis. As the immune system’s first line of defence, our skin is vital. “There really are full body and brain consequences to impairing it day after day with excessive skincare and harsh ingredients, particularly on younger vulnerable skin,” says DeFino.

as for what can be done

> To improve skincare practices, consumers should seek advice from credible medical professionals rather than influencers. This approach helps people understand which skin conditions can be legitimately treated and which are natural variations to accept, discouraging the pursuit of unnecessary or ineffective products. However, when it comes to protecting young people, much of the onus really falls on parents. “So much responsibility and focus has been put on the young girls who are doing these elaborate skincare routines,” says DeFino. “What we really need to recognise is that they are just playing with the world that we, the adults, have created for them.”
