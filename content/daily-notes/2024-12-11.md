I went to a reading group today, organized by my friend Jasmine. I decided to read my daily quota of Burkeman at the reading group. It was also fun introducing the book to the two other folks that were there.

I also realised I was overextending myself by trying to do my MathAcademy course before Christmas. I was ignoring a lot of other important things and being grumpy to the people around me. So decided to do some replanning and reprioritising. 

Which actually brings me right back to the book chapter I read

#### Meditations for Mortals Day Sixteen
This chapter is titled _The reverse golden rule: On not being your own worst enemy_

> Some might object that it’s a sign of immense privilege even to be able to contemplate spending the day doing what you feel like doing. And of course this is true, so far as it goes: almost everyone’s situation will impose certain limits on their freedom to follow their desires, and it’s much worse for some than for others. But it’s important to see that this objection itself is often the inner taskmaster in disguise, seeking to make you feel bad for taking advantage of whatever freedom you do have. There’s no prize for failing to spend your time as you wish, to whatever extent you’re able, out of a misplaced sense of solidarity with those who cannot.

> In any case, treating yourself a little more kindly needn’t be anywhere near as self-indulgent as those of us with an allergy to ‘self-compassion’ tend to assume. It’s not about narcissistically declaring yourself to be any more deserving of an easy life than anyone else. It’s quite sufficient a challenge to seek to follow what the philosopher Iddo Landau calls the ‘reverse golden rule’ – that is, not treating yourself in punishing and poisonous ways in which you’d never dream of treating someone else. Can you imagine berating a friend in the manner that many of us deem it acceptable to screech internally at ourselves, all day long? Adam Phillips is exactly right: were you to meet such a person at a party, they’d immediately strike you as obviously unbalanced. You might try to get them to leave, and possibly also seek help. It might occur to you that they must be damaged – that in Phillips’s words ‘something terrible’ must have happened to them – for them to think it appropriate to act that way.
