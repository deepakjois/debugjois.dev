#### TikTok Ban
[The Great Creator Reset - by Taylor Lorenz - User Mag](https://www.usermag.co/p/the-great-creator-reset)

> Since 2020, TikTok has [served as a major hub for progressive speech and activism](https://archive.ph/5IHAw#selection-1553.182-1561.161). The ban will deplatform thousands of progressive content creators and skew online discourse toward conservative ideologies. It will consolidate media influence within right leaning platforms like Meta and X. Over time, I believe this reconfiguration will permanently alter the political landscape of the creator economy.

…

> While the majority of news content creators across the social media landscape are conservative men, [a recent study found](https://www.usermag.co/p/the-majority-of-news-influencers) that TikTok is the _only_ platform where left-leaning news influencers outnumber right-leaning ones. TikTok also has more than double the concentration of news content creators who identify as LGBTQ+ or advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, and 73% of teens who identify as Democrats or lean left use TikTok, compared to 52% of teens who identify as Republican, [according to Pew Research](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2024/12/12/teens-social-media-and-technology-2024/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

#### The Masculinity Crisis as a Crisis of Self-Esteem

Yet another wonderful intervention in the masculinity crisis space. I seem to come across a lot of this lately.

> Our culture is saturated with this way of seeing ourselves: we increasingly describe even prosaic aspects of life as an expression of our uniqueness. Choosing what to study, or finding a job, requires a lot of soul-searching these days. We are all implored to follow our _passion_, with the implication that everybody ought to have one; wanting a normal career that leaves enough free time to be happy feels to some like an admission of inadequacy.

> The only way to maintain self-esteem under modern conditions is to outperform others – but there’s _always_ somebody doing better. To be average is to be profoundly unsatisfied, because the fact that (even a handful of) others are doing much better reveals one’s (supposed) intrinsic inferiority. That this dynamic plays out under a model of capitalism characterised by intense income and wealth inequality exacerbates the problem.
