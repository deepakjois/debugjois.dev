#### Mumbai Recs
A lovely friend sent along some very hyperlocal food recs for Mumbai #food 

> Chembur - my most fav vadapav in front of post office opens 4 or 5pm 
> 
> Matunga - Classic pav bhaji or DPs Pav bhaji if you’re interested to try South Indian: Ramashray or madras cafe, there’s a soya chaap wala near madras cafe that’s also v good. Gupta pani puri near the matunga station. Too many Guptas check for the right one haha
> 
> Sion : gurukripa samosa. Very famous supplies to most theatres and schools in Mumbai 
> 
> Dadar : Ashok Vada pav, sandwich also might be good in most places Bombay veg toast here.
> 
> Near marine drive : panini at Raju sandwich in front of KC college and K rustoms icecream is famous for the nostalgia value. I like the walnut crunch flavour there tho hahah
