#### Podscript Web UI
Finally shipped this after a few days of work: [Added web UI · deepakjois/podscript@0965b1e · GitHub](https://github.com/deepakjois/podscript/commit/0965b1e86add8eead46dc03d8acd740b5bf4b6d5) #go #tools #frontend 

Recorded a screencast to demo the UI.

#### Podscript Single Binary App
I used an interesting pattern to bundle UI assets into a Go binary for the podscript web frontend, so wanted to record that here.

Go supports asset embedding using the [embed](https://pkg.go.dev/embed) package, so it's very common for Go developers to ship a full app including a frontend using this technique. The podscript Web UI is a standard [Vite/React/Typescript/TailwindCSS app](https://github.com/deepakjois/podscript/tree/4fe4f822632cb1bb1b34d588eb91f3de025d578f/web/frontend), so I used the same technique to embed a [folder containing frontend build assets](https://github.com/deepakjois/podscript/blob/4fe4f822632cb1bb1b34d588eb91f3de025d578f/web.go#L18)

A couple of interesting things I did:
- During development, I wanted to use the Vite development server along with the Go backend together. So I used the [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) web server with a [reverse proxy config](https://github.com/deepakjois/podscript/blob/4fe4f822632cb1bb1b34d588eb91f3de025d578f/web/Caddyfile) to expose them on the same port. I also added a `--dev` [flag to the `web` subcommand](https://github.com/deepakjois/podscript/blob/4fe4f822632cb1bb1b34d588eb91f3de025d578f/web.go#L22) that would run in a mode where it would not use the embedded assets to serve the frontend.
- I used a [pre-commit hook](https://github.com/deepakjois/podscript/blob/4fe4f822632cb1bb1b34d588eb91f3de025d578f/hooks/pre-commit) to detect whenever files in the frontend changed, and ran the Vite production build and copied the assets where the Go build can pick it up. That way, the embedded frontend assets were always kept up to date, without me having to manually update them.

Have been enjoying the S2 of Severance, and following it along with threads on the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/) and the [Ringer podcast recaps](https://www.theringer.com/topic/severance).
