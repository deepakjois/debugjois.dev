#### Podscript Web UI
Finally shipped this after a few days of work: [Added web UI · deepakjois/podscript@0965b1e · GitHub](https://github.com/deepakjois/podscript/commit/0965b1e86add8eead46dc03d8acd740b5bf4b6d5) #go #tools #frontend 

Recorded a screencast to demo the UI.

#### Podscript Single Binary App
I used an interesting pattern to bundle UI assets into a Go binary for the podscript web frontend, so wanted to record that here.

Go supports asset embedding using the [embed](https://pkg.go.dev/embed) package, so it's very common for Go developers to ship a full app including a frontend using this technique. The podscript Web UI is a standard [Vite/React/Typescript/TailwindCSS app](https://github.com/deepakjois/podscript/tree/4fe4f822632cb1bb1b34d588eb91f3de025d578f/web/frontend), so I used the same technique to embed a [folder containing frontend build assets](https://github.com/deepakjois/podscript/blob/4fe4f822632cb1bb1b34d588eb91f3de025d578f/web.go#L18)

A couple of interesting things I did:
- During development, I wanted to use the Vite development server along with the Go backend together. So I used the [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) web server with a [reverse proxy config](https://github.com/deepakjois/podscript/blob/4fe4f822632cb1bb1b34d588eb91f3de025d578f/web/Caddyfile) to expose them on the same port. I also added a `--dev` [flag to the `web` subcommand](https://github.com/deepakjois/podscript/blob/4fe4f822632cb1bb1b34d588eb91f3de025d578f/web.go#L22) that would run in a mode where it would not use the embedded assets to serve the frontend.
- I used a [pre-commit hook](https://github.com/deepakjois/podscript/blob/4fe4f822632cb1bb1b34d588eb91f3de025d578f/hooks/pre-commit) to detect whenever files in the frontend changed, and ran the Vite production build and copied the assets where the Go build can pick it up. That way, the embedded frontend assets were always kept up to date, without me having to manually update them.
#### Severance
Have been enjoying the S2 of Severance, and following it along with threads on the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/) and the [Ringer podcast recaps](https://www.theringer.com/topic/severance). #tv #work #culture #pop-culture 

Came across this article in The Dazed which was surprisingly detailed: [Could the technology in Severance soon become reality? \| Dazed](https://www.dazeddigital.com/film-tv/article/65990/1/technology-in-severance-soon-become-reality-procedure-work-life-balance-science)

> It’s unsurprising that _Severance_ has been [described as “the series for our times”](https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/tv/2025/01/severance-review-series-for-our-times). In recent post-pandemic years, society has taken a decidedly anti-work turn: thousands quit their jobs during the [Great Resignation of 2021,](https://www.personio.com/hr-lexicon/the-great-resignation-uk/#:~:text=A%20new%20record%20of%204.5,Resignation%20is%20still%20going%20on.) Kim Kardashian quipped that “nobody wants to work these days” in 2022, and TikTok’s recent [](https://www.personio.com/hr-lexicon/the-great-resignation-uk/#:~:text=A%20new%20record%20of%204.5,Resignation%20is%20still%20going%20on.)[‘lazy girl job’ trend advocated for seeking out stress-free roles which require no brainpower](https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/60268/1/the-lazy-girl-job-trend-romanticises-the-drudgery-of-work-tiktok). Many _Severance_ viewers, desperate for a better work-life balance, have half-joked about wanting to be severed. But could the severance procedure ever become a reality?
