[Stop expecting your partner to fulfil all your needs | Dazed](https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/66529/1/stop-expecting-your-partner-to-fulfil-all-your-needs-dating-relationships-love) #dating #relationships #expectations

> But what if we’ve now swung to the other extreme? Many of us now expect our partners to be _everything_: our best friends, sexual playmates, therapists, running buddies, cheerleaders, and more. We don’t accept any traits that jar with our own or a single conflicting value – and it’s likely this is making dating harder for us all.

> But by approaching dating as nothing more than a tick-box exercise, we drive away possible moments of intimacy and connection. Contrasts in personalities, temperaments, and interests provide the push-and-pull needed to allow relationships to thrive. This doesn’t mean settling for someone who treats you poorly or forcing yourself to persevere with dating someone who doesn’t excite you. But if you like wild Friday nights and your partner prefers Netflix marathons, go party with your friends. If you love Sunday morning hikes and they don’t, go solo or find a buddy. A partner doesn’t have to be your everything.
