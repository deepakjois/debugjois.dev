I am supposed to start grinding on stuff today, but I have visitors coming so might not be able to fully lock in.

#### The Bookshop Woman
I have been reading The Bookshop Woman since I got it as a secret santa gift. It's a pity I am reading a physical copy, because I don't usually highlight or copy quotes from it. It has a lot of quotable bits that I believe folks will resonate with a lot.

#### Japanese Stationary
This tweet I made about Japanese Stationary seems to have reached a wider audience than normal.
