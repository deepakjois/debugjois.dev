Finally went to the doctor today, even though I was reluctant. As expected they prescribed an antibiotic and something to counteract the side-effects of the antibiotic. All this was before they received the blood test results. The blood test was another major ripoff. Apart from the standard CBC test, they included additional tests for Dengue and Typhoid which were super expensive and absolutely unnecessary. I wasn't paying attention, so I only realized later what I ended up paying for.

The blood test came back normal. So basically it's likely some viral infection which is taking its time to get out of my system. The antibiotics are useless against a viral infection, so there is no use taking them (but the doctor asked me to complete my three day dosage anyway). 

I have decided to learn to interpret my own blood test results and do my own research on common diagnosis for viral and bacterial fevers and infections. Nearly every established brand that operates a clinic cares only about their bottomline. Sigh ðŸ˜”!

What makes it worse is that today is Diwali ðŸª”!
