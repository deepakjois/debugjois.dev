#### Evolution and Irrationality
[Flat Earthers on a Cruise: How evolution wired us to act against our own best interests | The MIT Press Reader](https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/why-human-irrationality-is-evolutionary-not-accidental/) #evolution #rationality

> All of these behaviors illustrate our evolutionary inertia. We are descended from animals that had to make fast decisions — about food, threats, and reproduction. There was no time for deliberation; quick but flawed judgment meant survival. Thus, irrationality, or at least a limited and pragmatic rationality, has made it possible for us to survive (which does not implicitly mean that it is justified today). This compromise between speed and accuracy generates a cascade of imperfections and snap judgments.

> As psychologist Gerd Gigerenzer argues, from our evolutionary past, we have inherited an adaptive, contextual form of reasoning that is neither logical nor probabilistic, but good enough to keep us alive. We’re wired to scan for threats, anticipate others’ behavior, and infer meaning, even when none exists. This explains why we tend to attribute cause-and-effect relationships between totally unrelated phenomena, such as stepping under a ladder and failing an exam, and draw broad conclusions from anecdotes. A great deal of the data from developmental psychology, anthropology, and neuroscience [confirms that](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200409233511326), for adaptive reasons that no longer exist, our minds have evolved a strong tendency to distinguish between inert entities, such as physical objects, and entities of a psychological nature, like animate agents. We thus are dualists and animists by nature. As a result, we attribute purposes and intentions to things, even when none exist, and imagine hidden motives and conspiracies where there are none. For us, stories always have a purpose, which can be evident or hidden.

> We are, in short, belief machines, and we manufacture a lot of those beliefs. And when belief comforts us or helps us make sense of a chaotic world, we cling to it, no matter how irrational. We’re even willing to endure ridicule, as in the case of flat-earthers who set out on a cruise to reach the ends of the earth. They never reached it, but afterward, [many found ways to explain why](https://www.denverpost.com/2025/01/17/flat-earth-final-experiment-antarctica-will-duffy/).


> Levi saw technical and narrative invention as forms of tinkering, building on existing materials and constraints, just like evolution itself. For Levi, humanity is capable of both sublime achievement and unimaginable horror. In his appendix to “If This Is a Man,” he writes that the extermination camps are nonhuman, even counter-human inventions. But there can be no return to Arcadia; we must forge ahead as our own blacksmiths. The only true antidote to falling back into “inhumanism,” according to Levi, is critical and self-critical rationalism. Not a perfect logic, but a skeptical and methodical approach, whose first lesson is simple: Distrust all the prophets that manipulate the imperfections of the human mind.

#### The Performative Man
[Social media is obsessed with ‘performative men’ – also known as men](http://archive.today/JjvFF)

> The contestants at the “Performative Male Contest,” dozens of young men, milled around the park conspicuously but nonchalantly, waiting to be noticed and judged by an audience of several hundred onlookers.
> 
> To encourage this attention, they donned T-shirts with feminist slogans, baggy jeans and pink Nikes. They [buried their noses](https://archive.ph/o/JjvFF/https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8kpwo4y/) in the first few pages of noticeably uncreased copies of “Women’s Bodies, Women’s Wisdom” by Christiane Northrup, “Period Power” by Maisie Hill and “Becoming” by Michelle Obama. In their requisite canvas totes, they toted disposable cameras, albums by pop chanteuse Clairo (on vinyl of course) and, if room remained, their ukuleles (employed to deploy unsolicited and [aggressively twee covers of Beyoncé songs](https://archive.ph/o/JjvFF/https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8ksJSqY/)). Almost uniformly, they sipped bright green iced matcha oat milk lattes from clear plastic cups.
