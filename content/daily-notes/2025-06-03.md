#### Extravagant Weddings as a Costly Signal
[Why Extravagant Weddings Are On The Rise At The Same Time Marital Rates Are In Decline](https://www.robkhenderson.com/p/why-extravagant-weddings-are-on-the)

> Marriage itself used to be a costly signal of commitment. Today, [extravagant weddings](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2023/06/20/wedding-budget-costs-expensive-expectations/70314812007/) serve this purpose.
> 
> Recall that [costly signaling](https://www.robkhenderson.com/p/theres-nothing-wrong-with-signaling) theory states that if you want to show you’re serious about something—your strength, your loyalty, your commitment—you have to incur a cost that’s hard to fake.

> In other words, costly weddings have come to signal what marriage itself used to convey—that you're in it for the long haul.
> 
> People no longer trust the institution of marriage to signal commitment on its own, so they feel the need to stage it. In the past, marriage came with clear expectations—social, religious, and legal—that gave it weight and a common understanding of permanence. That’s no longer the case. So now, couples turn to performance. The wedding isn’t just a celebration. It’s a production. Outfits, lighting, music, a curated guest list. The whole thing is designed to prove, to everyone watching, that this is real. This is serious.
> 
> Interestingly, this ends up punishing the very people most in need of the stability that marriage can offer. Not because they don’t want to get married, but because the cost of looking committed keeps rising.

oh well, imo it's just another reason to move beyond marriage tbh 🤷🏽‍♂️!
