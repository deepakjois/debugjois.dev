#### Extravagant Weddings as a Costly Signal
[Why Extravagant Weddings Are On The Rise At The Same Time Marital Rates Are In Decline](https://www.robkhenderson.com/p/why-extravagant-weddings-are-on-the)

> Marriage itself used to be a costly signal of commitment. Today, [extravagant weddings](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2023/06/20/wedding-budget-costs-expensive-expectations/70314812007/) serve this purpose.
> 
> Recall that [costly signaling](https://www.robkhenderson.com/p/theres-nothing-wrong-with-signaling) theory states that if you want to show you’re serious about something—your strength, your loyalty, your commitment—you have to incur a cost that’s hard to fake.

> In other words, costly weddings have come to signal what marriage itself used to convey—that you're in it for the long haul.
> 
> People no longer trust the institution of marriage to signal commitment on its own, so they feel the need to stage it. In the past, marriage came with clear expectations—social, religious, and legal—that gave it weight and a common understanding of permanence. That’s no longer the case. So now, couples turn to performance. The wedding isn’t just a celebration. It’s a production. Outfits, lighting, music, a curated guest list. The whole thing is designed to prove, to everyone watching, that this is real. This is serious.
> 
> Interestingly, this ends up punishing the very people most in need of the stability that marriage can offer. Not because they don’t want to get married, but because the cost of looking committed keeps rising.

oh well, imo it's just another reason to move beyond marriage tbh 🤷🏽‍♂️!

#### The Recurring Cycle of 'Developer Replacement' Hype
[The Recurring Cycle of 'Developer Replacement' Hype](https://alonso.network/the-recurring-cycle-of-developer-replacement-hype/) #ai #software #jobs 

The cycles so far

- The NoCode/LowCode Revolution
- The Cloud Revolution
- The Offshore Development Wave
- The AI Coding Assistant Revolution

> Here's what the "AI will replace developers" crowd fundamentally misunderstands: **code is not an asset—it's a liability.** Every line must be maintained, debugged, secured, and eventually replaced. The real asset is the business capability that code enables.
> 
> If AI makes writing code faster and cheaper, it's really making it easier to create liability. When you can generate liability at unprecedented speed, the ability to manage and minimize that liability strategically becomes exponentially more valuable.
> 
> This is particularly true because AI excels at local optimization but fails at global design. It can optimize individual functions but can't determine whether a service should exist in the first place, or how it should interact with the broader system. When implementation speed increases dramatically, architectural mistakes get baked in before you realize they're mistakes.
> 
> For agency work building disposable marketing sites, this doesn't matter. For systems that need to evolve over years, it's catastrophic.
> 
> The pattern of technological transformation remains consistent—sysadmins became DevOps engineers, backend developers became cloud architects—but AI accelerates everything. The skill that survives and thrives isn't writing code.
> 
> It's architecting systems. And that's the one thing AI can't do.

#### GenAI is our polyester
[GenAI is Our Polyester](https://culture.ghost.io/genai-is-our-polyester/) #genai  #ai #slop 

> Everyone knows happened next: There was a massive cultural backlash against polyester, which led to the triumphant revaluation of natural fibers such as cotton and linen. The stigma against polyester persists even now. The backlash is often explained as a rejection of its weaknesses as a fiber: polyester's poor aeration makes it feel sticky.
>
> But there was also a massive _aesthetic_ backlash to polyester, and this can't be separated from the fabric's social position. From the 1980s, cotton growers ran a [massive advertising campaign](https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/15/business/advertising-new-look-in-cotton-campaign.html?ref=culture.ghost.io) to raise its profile among wealthy Americans and re-establish the fiber as luxurious. _The Official Preppy Handbook_ arrived at the same time with the guidance: "Wool, cotton, and the odd bits of silk and cashmere are the only acceptable materials for Prep clothes." The book's editor Lisa Birnbach warned that a "small percentage of polyester" can ruin a shirt, and pointed to the fraying collar of over-washed cotton shirt as a status symbol. By this point, the connotation of polyester was no longer “high-tech” but _low-class_. This class bias imbued polyester with a negative status value that made it ultimately _look_ ugly.
> 
> …
> 
> Today manufacturers continue to use polyester-cotton blends to create “wrinkle-free” garments, but the stigmas remain. A “beautiful” shirt from a high-end brand comes in real cotton or linen, despite all the inefficiencies involved.

> I rehash the rise and fall of polyester because I believe it presages what will happen to **generative AI art**.
> 
> …
> 
> While polyester took a few decades to lose its appeal, GenAI is already feeling a bit cheesy. We're only a few years into the AI Revolution, and Facebook and X are filled to the brim with “[AI slop](https://www.garbageday.email/p/meta-has-a-cool-new-slop-feed?ref=culture.ghost.io).” Everyone around the world has near-equal access to these tools, and low-skilled South and Southeast Asian content farmers are [the most active creators](https://www.404media.co/where-facebooks-ai-slop-comes-from/?ref=culture.ghost.io) because their wages are low enough for the platforms' economic incentives to be attractive.

> Humans have no universal faculty to judge aesthetics: Our appreciation of beauty is highly-contextual and depends on factors other than the raw visual stimulus. Most tech-workers are unaware of this fact, and for them, the fact that AI-art resembles human-art means it must be pretty damn good. But AI art is already in very poor taste: not just because it recycles existing conventions in a way that looks outmoded, but because it's already overly associated with less-than-prestigious institutions. GenAI art has already reached polyester status, and this is just the beginning. Despite all the techno-utopian promises, our brains see it as ersatz.

#### Software Engineering and Manufacturing
[Why GUIs are built at least 2.5 times \| Patricia Aas](https://patricia.no/2025/05/30/why_lean_software_dev_is_wrong.html) #software #engineering #manufacturing 

> That being said, when you strip away all the theoretical jargon of postmodernism, its theorists were simply describing _an extinction-level destruction of cultural value_. Our era's particular neoliberal hyper-connected, hyper-capitalist economy is creating a lot of profit for a few people, but it’s absolutely devastating for the creation of deep meaning. This is the main conclusion of [_Status and Culture_](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/659558/status-and-culture-by-w-david-marx/?ref=culture.ghost.io): artifacts and styles take on their full value within a social context, and less value is created when all cultural artifacts are procurable with enough money, can be made anywhere by anyone, and offer no useful social distinctions between philistine and aesthete. AI is simply the latest step in this long process of devaluation — auguring a future where the entire fabric of our lives, from top to bottom, becomes polyester.
> 
> But the historical rejection of polyester gives me hope. Humans ultimately are built to pursue value, and create it where it doesn’t exist. When small groups invent new sources of value, others notice and want in. The more that the economy embraces synthetic culture, the more we'll be primed for a revival of non-synthetic culture. But this is where _you_ come in: We have to be ready to fully embrace this return of human-made art. Our generation's polyester salespeople are not deep thinkers and they don't care about the externalities of what they're doing. They’re here to sell us polyester. We don’t have to buy it, but more importantly, we don't have to feel bad about not buying it.

> Software development has a weird attribute, making 1 app locally on your machine that you deploy locally to your phone as a hobby, can take days/months/years. But once it is “done” you can put it in an app store or online, and all subsequent copies are “free to produce”. This is not how manufacturing works. Making item 2 and 3 has cost, in materials and labour. But in software all of, or the overwhelming amount of, cost is in making the _first_ one (maybe you have some per user infrastructure etc).
> 
> So the perspective is wrong. Developers don’t produce code. Developers are trying to design a solution to a problem, and that is not done in isolation, and more “stuff” isn’t necessarily better.
> 
> Like imagine you like a minimalistic style, putting more and more stuff into your house doesn’t make it better, it makes it worse.
> 
> The goal isn’t to write code faster, it’s to make something that is valuable to someone.
> 
> …
> 
> The manufacturing perspective just doesn’t fit: we have no material cost (copies are free), we have no labour cost for manufacturing (copies are free), we don’t need a factory (copies can be made on a laptop). This is a very different thing than the manufacturing of physical things. It’s even different from the design process for manufacturing of physical things, because you can design a bridge, but building the bridge still costs money. And so does the next bridge from that same design. That’s not software.
> 
> Another weird thing about software is that we can fundamentally change it after it’s “done”. Even after the customer has it. We can continue to change it, for decades and decades.

#### Christophe Nuyens on whether artistic ability can be taught
[Cinematography of “Andor” – interview with Christophe Nuyens ·  Pushing Pixels](https://www.pushing-pixels.org/2025/05/20/cinematography-of-andor-interview-with-christophe-nuyens.html)

> _Kirill: Do you feel that you can teach the technical part, but the artistic part comes from within a person, and if one doesn’t have it, it can’t be learned?_
> 
> Christophe: No, I think you can teach both. When I was growing up, I didn’t have a lot of cultural influences in my life, at home or at school. It is something that I grew over the years. When I started at the film school, I noticed that I needed to catch up on it. I spent a lot of evenings around that time watching movies with my friends, and it grew on me.
> 
> You can cultivate it the same way you cultivate the technical skills. There are also people who are more artistic than technical. Maybe I am more naturally inclined to be better at the technical side, but I grew and worked on my creative side over the years. I really believe you can grow the creative part of your brain.
