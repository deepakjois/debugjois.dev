#### Extravagant Weddings as a Costly Signal
[Why Extravagant Weddings Are On The Rise At The Same Time Marital Rates Are In Decline](https://www.robkhenderson.com/p/why-extravagant-weddings-are-on-the)

> Marriage itself used to be a costly signal of commitment. Today, [extravagant weddings](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2023/06/20/wedding-budget-costs-expensive-expectations/70314812007/) serve this purpose.
> 
> Recall that [costly signaling](https://www.robkhenderson.com/p/theres-nothing-wrong-with-signaling) theory states that if you want to show you’re serious about something—your strength, your loyalty, your commitment—you have to incur a cost that’s hard to fake.

> In other words, costly weddings have come to signal what marriage itself used to convey—that you're in it for the long haul.
> 
> People no longer trust the institution of marriage to signal commitment on its own, so they feel the need to stage it. In the past, marriage came with clear expectations—social, religious, and legal—that gave it weight and a common understanding of permanence. That’s no longer the case. So now, couples turn to performance. The wedding isn’t just a celebration. It’s a production. Outfits, lighting, music, a curated guest list. The whole thing is designed to prove, to everyone watching, that this is real. This is serious.
> 
> Interestingly, this ends up punishing the very people most in need of the stability that marriage can offer. Not because they don’t want to get married, but because the cost of looking committed keeps rising.

oh well, imo it's just another reason to move beyond marriage tbh 🤷🏽‍♂️!

#### The Recurring Cycle of 'Developer Replacement' Hype
[The Recurring Cycle of 'Developer Replacement' Hype](https://alonso.network/the-recurring-cycle-of-developer-replacement-hype/) #ai #software #jobs 

The cycles so far

- The NoCode/LowCode Revolution
- The Cloud Revolution
- The Offshore Development Wave
- The AI Coding Assistant Revolution

> Here's what the "AI will replace developers" crowd fundamentally misunderstands: **code is not an asset—it's a liability.** Every line must be maintained, debugged, secured, and eventually replaced. The real asset is the business capability that code enables.
> 
> If AI makes writing code faster and cheaper, it's really making it easier to create liability. When you can generate liability at unprecedented speed, the ability to manage and minimize that liability strategically becomes exponentially more valuable.
> 
> This is particularly true because AI excels at local optimization but fails at global design. It can optimize individual functions but can't determine whether a service should exist in the first place, or how it should interact with the broader system. When implementation speed increases dramatically, architectural mistakes get baked in before you realize they're mistakes.
> 
> For agency work building disposable marketing sites, this doesn't matter. For systems that need to evolve over years, it's catastrophic.
> 
> The pattern of technological transformation remains consistent—sysadmins became DevOps engineers, backend developers became cloud architects—but AI accelerates everything. The skill that survives and thrives isn't writing code.
> 
> It's architecting systems. And that's the one thing AI can't do.

#### GenAI is our polyester
[GenAI is Our Polyester](https://culture.ghost.io/genai-is-our-polyester/) #genai  #ai #slop 

> Everyone knows happened next: There was a massive cultural backlash against polyester, which led to the triumphant revaluation of natural fibers such as cotton and linen. The stigma against polyester persists even now. The backlash is often explained as a rejection of its weaknesses as a fiber: polyester's poor aeration makes it feel sticky.
>
> But there was also a massive _aesthetic_ backlash to polyester, and this can't be separated from the fabric's social position. From the 1980s, cotton growers ran a [massive advertising campaign](https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/15/business/advertising-new-look-in-cotton-campaign.html?ref=culture.ghost.io) to raise its profile among wealthy Americans and re-establish the fiber as luxurious. _The Official Preppy Handbook_ arrived at the same time with the guidance: "Wool, cotton, and the odd bits of silk and cashmere are the only acceptable materials for Prep clothes." The book's editor Lisa Birnbach warned that a "small percentage of polyester" can ruin a shirt, and pointed to the fraying collar of over-washed cotton shirt as a status symbol. By this point, the connotation of polyester was no longer “high-tech” but _low-class_. This class bias imbued polyester with a negative status value that made it ultimately _look_ ugly.
