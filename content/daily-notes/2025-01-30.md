#### Is Brain rot real
[Is internet-induced brain rot a myth? | Dazed](https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/65971/1/is-internet-induced-brain-rot-a-myth-phone-addiction-social-media) #distractions #social-media #screen-time 

> Przybylski, who has spent years researching the impact of technology on cognition and well-being, argues that the moral panic around phones lacks sufficient evidence. He also points to a rise in opinion pieces and bestselling books that make sweeping claims without rigorous scientific backing. “The ideas in these books are not peer-reviewed,” he says. In 2023, Przybylski and his colleagues analysed data from almost 12,000 children in the US, aged between nine and 12, and found no link between screen time and brain connectivity or well-being. “If you publish a study like we do, where we cross our Ts, dot our Is, state our hypotheses before we see the data, and share the data and code, those types of studies don’t show the negative effects people expect.”
> 
> Gary Small, chair of psychiatry at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey, similarly agrees with Przybylski. Having studied the potential harms and benefits of digital technology, he argues that, to his knowledge, “there’s no compelling evidence that using digital technology or devices causes permanent brain damage.” Instead, he tells the _Guardian_ that people should “be smart about how you use your devices. Manage the devices – don’t let them manage you.”

#### Workplace Sexual Dynamics

> According to [Kate Daly](https://amicable.io/kate-daly), relationship expert and co-founder of online divorce services company [amicable](https://amicable.io/), it’s no coincidence that you can develop feelings for people you work with – it’s a phenomenon known as the exposure effect. “Spending significant time with colleagues creates familiarity and comfort, which can then lead to romantic feelings,” Daly says that intimacy and emotional connection often build due to regular conversations, something facilitated by the nine-to-five. “As more people return to a physical office either by choice or by ‘order of the management’, the exposure effect is fuelling office romances in a way we haven’t seen since before 2019. As the pendulum swings away from the treadmill and expense of dating apps, IRL encounters in the workplace become an attractive alternative where you can take the ‘blindness’ out of a date and get to know someone before having to spend money on drinks and dinner.”

#### The Authority Framework

Seems like a lot of slop, but keeping it around in case it felt like it was just about interesting enough that I might wanna revisit the idea.

#### Start a Blog
[Advice for a friend who wants to start a blog](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/start-a-blog) #writing 

> People tend to sound more like themselves in chat messages than in blog posts. So perhaps write in the chat, rapidly, to a friend.

> Not that many people will care about what you write, at least for the first few years, so make the writing useful to you. Write in a way that lets you [refine your thoughts about the things that matter](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/writing-to-think). Write to experience what you care about in higher resolution—write to enhance your feeling of aliveness.

#### Candace Owens
[Candace Owens launches new women's media platform](https://www.usermag.co/p/candace-owens-new-media-company-club-candace-daily-wire-independent) #tradition #conservatism #gender 

> In Owens' view, the digital media industry has abandoned these women. After the traditional women's magazine industry crumbled, a generation of digital media companies sold millennial women on female empowerment and girlboss corporate feminism—_Lean In_-style articles that encouraged women to climb the corporate ladder while juggling a family life. But recently, more women have become disillusioned by this promise. Owens recognizes an opportunity to sell them something different.

> There has been a significant resurgence of anti-feminist media aimed at promoting traditional gender roles and a homemaker lifestyle to women in recent years. Tradwife influencers like Nara Smith and Hannah Neeleman have surged in popularity, amassing millions of followers across social media. Peter Thiel-linked [Evie Magazine launched to sell far-right ideals to Gen Z women](https://archive.ph/eYV8r). And a growing network of podcasts and app-based platforms such as "[The Homemaker's Club](https://www.wearethehomemakers.com/)" encourage women to adopt conservative values.

#### When Cruelty Becomes Cool
[When Cruelty Becomes Cool - by Parker Molloy](https://www.readtpa.com/p/when-cruelty-becomes-cool) #wokeness #language #slur

> With Donald Trump’s return to power, one of the most disturbing trends in public discourse has been the casual revival of what was, until recently, widely understood to be an offensive slur — [the r-word](https://www.specialolympics.org/stories/impact/why-the-r-word-is-the-r-slur). This resurgence isn't happening in some dark corner of the internet, but in mainstream spaces, and is now being promoted by influential voices who seem emboldened by Trump's victory.
> 
> Miles Klee at _[Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/r-word-elon-musk-maga-1235226732/)_ documented the trend earlier this month, highlighting how the word has roared back into common usage across social media platforms. From podcast hosts to tech billionaires, from conservative influencers to ostensibly centrist pundits, the word is being deliberately deployed as a rejection of what they dismissively call "wokeness."
>
> As Brock Colyar's disturbing dispatch from Trump's inauguration celebrations in _[New York](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/inauguration-trump-supporters-conservative-movement-post-maga.html)_ magazine illustrates, there's a new breed of young conservative for whom offensive language isn't just acceptable — it's a way to demonstrate their bonafides with the ingroup. These aren't the stereotypical MAGA devotees. They're young, urban professionals who view cruelty as both entertainment and ideology.

Policing the use of certain words and phrases has definitely been taken to extremes in the name of wokeness, but this phenomena of celebrating the use of offensive words especially with undertones of establishing dominance and belonging to a group, is equally problematic.

#### ChatGPT as the AltaVista of 2025
[Trump’s Inflation and AI Are More Important Than the Fed - Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-29/trump-s-inflation-and-ai-are-more-important-than-the-fed) #chatgpt #business 

This section was kinda brilliant

> **Think of ChatGPT in 2025 as AltaVista in the year 2000**
> 
> I think there are a lot of  parallels to the Internet Bubble here. We have this new technological advance which will have huge ramifications for the future. But no one knows how much money to invest, how long it will take before investments garner profits, or what business models will make any money. Least of all, we don’t know who will come out on top.

> It’s just a ‘build it and they will come’ Field of Dreams story at this point. Every single one of the companies we see now active in artificial intelligence could end up being a market loser 10 years from now.

> In the late 1990s, there were a host of search engines trying to take what seemed at the time to be firehose amount of data and help users navigate to exactly the information they were looking for. Companies like Lycos, Excite, Yahoo, InfoSeek, AskJeeves and AltaVista were all plying their trade well before the dominant player today, Google, was founded in 1998.
> 
> If you had asked anyone who would be the winner, AltaVista would have been as good an answer as any. I asked ChatGPT “what happened to AltaVista?” It said this:
> 
> > “AltaVista was launched by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in December 1995. It quickly became one of the most popular search engines of the mid-90s due to its advanced technology, which indexed the full text of web pages and returned faster and more relevant results compared to other engines at the time.
> > 
> > [...]
> > 
> > ...AltaVista was acquired by **Overture Services** (an internet marketing company) in 2003, which itself was later purchased by **Yahoo!**. AltaVista was eventually folded into Yahoo!’s operations.”
> 
>Translation: AltaVista was an Internet loser.
> 
> Search became a huge revenue generator because of advertising. But AltaVista wasn’t the one who got the dollars. It was Google, a very late entrant into the crowded search market.
