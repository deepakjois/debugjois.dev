- [Depression as a Functional Signal  | Hans Schroder  | Evolving Psychiatry Podcast #31 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgppkCeq2ww) #depression #evo-psych #evolution - Dr. Schroeder's research focuses on how mental health conditions like depression and anxiety can be seen as "functional signals" rather than as disorders stemming solely from genetic or biochemical origins. This approach may shift both self-perception and treatment outcomes, encouraging a view of mental health challenges as potentially useful signals indicating unmet needs or life changes.

- [Why Chinese migrants are crossing dangerous jungle to reach America](https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2024/10/08/why-chinese-migrants-are-crossing-dangerous-jungle-to-reach-america) #china #migrants - Honestly kinda blown away by this podcast. I couldn't have imagined that among migrants trying to make their way to the US from the south, there would be a decent number from China. Quoting from the podcast: _This route is taken by many desperate migrants from countries torn apart by war, crime and poverty. But in the last few years, more and more Chinese people have been taking this route to reach the U.S. to. Last year there were more than 37,000. That’s nearly ten times more than the year before and 50 times more than the year before that. And that surprised me. Because China is a superpower. It’s the second largest economy in the world. It’s at peace. And it’s strong enough to challenge America for global dominance. I wanted to understand who are these Chinese migrants? What is driving them out of China and what awaits them in America?_.

#### Key Points from Depression as a Functional Signal - Evolving Psychiatry Podcast
Podcast on Youtube: [Depression as a Functional Signal  | Hans Schroder  | Evolving Psychiatry Podcast #31 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgppkCeq2ww)

- **Reframing Depression as Functional**: Dr. Schroeder emphasizes that emotions, including depression, have evolutionary functions that can signal aspects of life requiring attention, such as relationships, unmet needs, or values misalignment. This contrasts with the common medical framing of mental health as a biochemical or genetic "imbalance."
- **Impacts on Self-Perception and Stigma**: Schroeder’s studies suggest that framing depression as a signal reduces self-stigmatization and increases willingness to discuss mental health struggles. The functional perspective allows patients to see their symptoms as a normal response rather than as a defect, fostering greater self-compassion and openness to change.
- **Challenges in Clinical Messaging**: Despite its promise, Dr. Schroeder notes that patients and practitioners alike often default to medical explanations. This is reinforced by the lasting cultural impact of campaigns like the "chemical imbalance" theory, even though such explanations are outdated. However, medical students and practitioners are rarely exposed to alternative evolutionary or functional perspectives in their training.
- **Mixed Findings in Research**: While reframing mental health issues as functional signals has shown promise in reducing stigma and enhancing adaptive beliefs, Dr. Schroeder acknowledges that his studies yielded small effect sizes. He plans future studies, including interventions targeting medical students, to assess whether early exposure to this perspective could impact treatment approaches.

#### Tips for improving concentration
A friend pointed me [to a PDF](https://umanitoba.ca/sites/default/files/2020-07/tips-for-improving-concentration.pdf) on the University of Manitoba Site titled _Tips for Improving Concentration_. Most of it is the usual stuff. But a couple of things were useful, so I am noting them down here:

* **Use Active Learning Strategies**: It is easier to stay focused on your studies when you use active learning strategies. Don’t just read; read out loud, use a highlighter, and write notes in the margins of your book. Ask yourself questions while you read and during class, take notes in class to stay focused, and try to make connections between the subject matter and its real world applications.
* **The Spider Technique**: When you hold a tuning fork up to a spider web, the spider will notice the vibrations and come looking for its food. After a while the spider will figure out that there is no food, and it will stop responding to the vibrations. In the same way, you can train yourself to ignore distractions, like people talking or phone notifications. Let the world go on around you without diverting your attention. In other words, learn to ignore the insignificant vibrations (Schuette, 1989).
* **Wedging**: The wedging strategy is one way to get started so that inertia and momentum can naturally take over. To begin, sit down and focus on studying for a minimum of five minutes. After five minutes, you can decide to keep going, or you can take a break. If you decide to take a break, that’s fine, but time your break and make a commitment to study for another five minutes once your break is over. This way you can build up your focus gradually and still get some work done (McMaster SWC, 2011).A
