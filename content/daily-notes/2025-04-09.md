> I find that “inquiring together” works best when you are traveling together, and confronted with _new_ questions.  They can be as mundane as “do you think the two people at that restaurant table are on a first date or not?”  From the point of view of the observers, the inquiry is de novo.  And the joint inquiry will be fun, and may make some progress.  You both have more or less the same starting point.  There isn’t really a better way to proceed, short of asking them.

> For most established social science and philosophy questions, however, there is so much preexisting analysis and literature that the “chains of thought” are very long.  The frontier point is not well maintained by a dyadic conversation, because doing so is computationally complex and further the two individuals likely have at least marginally separate agendas.  So the pair end up talking around in circles, rather than progressively.  It would be better if one person wrote a short memo or brief and the other offered comments.  In fact we usethat method frequently, and fairly often it succeeds in keeping the dialogue at the epistemic frontier.
