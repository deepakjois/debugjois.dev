#### The purpose of a system is what it does
[The purpose of a system is what it does \| Des Traynor](https://destraynor.com/writing/the-purpose-of-a-system-is-what-it-does/) #system #complexity 

> When you’re building, running, or ultimately accountable for any mature system anywhere, the first thing you should understand that is that the purpose of the system is what it does.
> 
> The nature of working in a startup is that most business functions are either non-existent or broken and your job (regardless of when you join, honestly) is to help get them working well. Even the founders of the best companies I know, as in the $10B+ ones, will admit that whole chunks of the company are works in progress held together with duct tape at best, and blu tack at worst.
> 
> The job as an early hire in any function is to make it work well, and the evaluation of whether you did that will be simply: **did that happen**? Your intentions don’t matter. Your excuses don’t matter. Not to be all James Heftfield, but _nothing else matters_. The purpose of a system is what it does.
