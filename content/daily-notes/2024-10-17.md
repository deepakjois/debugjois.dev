Talked to a lot of people on Twitter DMs, which does not happen often.

#### AI Tinkerers Meetup
I gave a talk about [podscript](https://github.com/deepakjois) at the [AI Tinkerers Meetup](https://bengaluru.aitinkerers.org/). It was some good public speaking practise after a long hiatus. Initially, I thought about going in and doing a spontaneous talk. But as I waited for the event to start at the nearby coffee shop, I decided to do a quick dry run and realised I would go over the 5min limit quite easily. So I cut down some material and tightened up a few things. Practising the talk definitely helped and I could feel it in the audience reaction during and after the talk. It felt very validating. Some folks came up to speak to me after, and after that I summoned up the courage to speak to some others as well. Told them all to follow me on X for the best vibes ðŸ˜Š.
