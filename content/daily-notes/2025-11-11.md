#### Psychology of Craft

> One of the imperatives in contemporary, professional work culture is to “grow.” There is often a sense of height or largeness with that imperative, as if growth must be measured in your distance up the ladder, your territory across the way. In _The Soul’s Code,_ James Hillman implores us to think rather of [growing _down_](https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/grow-down), of growth not of branch but root, of becoming more grounded, sturdier, less able to be pushed around by the whims of others.


> The question I hear is, what does it mean to see our work as craft rather than as growth? What are we shaping, handling, or doing something with? The metaphor of growth is one of hunger, consumption, acquisition—to acquire more pips on your collar, more titles after your name, more people under your domain. But craft asks instead, what are you doing? What reality comes into being with your shaping and working? What is in your hands and in your heart?
