#### Third Places
[What Is A Third Place? And How To Find One - The Good Trade](https://www.thegoodtrade.com/features/third-place-community-spaces/)

> A third place is a familiar public spot where you regularly connect with others known and unknown, over a shared interest or activity. The term was coined by [Ray Oldenburg](https://www.pps.org/article/roldenburg) in the early 1990s, as increasing work hours and more heavily siloed communities (think: Suburbs) became the norm. Because when you have access to everything you could possibly want or need at home (or online), leaving the house becomes optional.

> The best kind of third place is accessible and is one that invites us into close proximity with people we may not meet otherwise. These days, third places look like a bar or cafe with an affordable happy hour, but they can also look like community meeting spaces, churches, or libraries. Particularly, these locations can be especially important for [seniors](https://findingspress.org/article/124837-influence-of-neighborhood-walkability-on-older-adults-walking-behavior-health-and-social-connections-in-third-places) and for anyone living in areas facing economic hardship. [By breaking down social siloes](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2016/09/14/third-places-as-community-builders/), third spaces put people in touch.
