[What Is A Third Place? And How To Find One - The Good Trade](https://www.thegoodtrade.com/features/third-place-community-spaces/)

> A third place is a familiar public spot where you regularly connect with others known and unknown, over a shared interest or activity. The term was coined by [Ray Oldenburg](https://www.pps.org/article/roldenburg) in the early 1990s, as increasing work hours and more heavily siloed communities (think: Suburbs) became the norm. Because when you have access to everything you could possibly want or need at home (or online), leaving the house becomes optional.
