Off to Mumbai

Travel means a LOT of podcasts 🙃 #podcasts:
* Jamil Zaki has written a new book, and he appeared on a couple of podcasts on my feed to promote it. Managed to listen to them in quick sucession: [Amazon.com: Hope for Cynics: The Surprising Science of Human Goodness eBook : Zaki, Jamil: Kindle Store](https://www.amazon.com/Hope-Cynics-Surprising-Science-Goodness-ebook/dp/B0CR93L55W) #books

[High Modernism made our world - by Henry Farrell](https://www.programmablemutter.com/p/high-modernism-made-our-world)

> So what does this have to do with modern information technology? Quite straightforwardly: if you read Scott, you will see marked similarities between e.g. the ambitions of 1960s bureaucrats, convinced that they can plan out countries and cities for “abstract citizens” and the visions of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, convinced that algorithms and objective functions would create a more efficient and more harmonious world.

> Scott suggested the value of _metis_ - “the kind of knowledge that can be acquired only by long practice at similar but rarely identical tasks, which requires constant adaptation to changing circumstances.” This is the kind of tacit knowledge that peasants come to build about their land and the weather, or that people in less regimented societies accumulate about how to live with others in tolerable peace. Scott - an anarchist - greatly preferred this latter kind of knowledge, and the societies that valued it more, to the kind of world we live in today.
