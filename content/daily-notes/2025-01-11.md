Great article by Anthropic cutting through the bullshit and hype of AI agents.

> "Agent" can be defined in several ways. Some customers define agents as fully autonomous systems that operate independently over extended periods, using various tools to accomplish complex tasks. Others use the term to describe more prescriptive implementations that follow predefined workflows. At Anthropic, we categorize all these variations as **agentic systems**, but draw an important architectural distinction between **workflows** and **agents**:
> 
> - **Workflows** are systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths.
> - **Agents**, on the other hand, are systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks.

#### Modern Internet Culture Seen Through The Lens of British Politics
[What Elon Musk’s tweets about sex abuse reveal about British politics](https://www.economist.com/britain/2025/01/09/what-elon-musks-tweets-about-sex-abuse-reveal-about-british-politics)

> Listen to this story.

ELON MUSK’S barrage of posts about sexual-abuse scandals in Britain tells you a lot about the temperament of the owner of X, a man with the ear of America’s president-elect. The predation by largely Pakistani gangs on girls in English towns was first seriously reported on in 2011. Sir Keir Starmer, the prime minister (who was chief prosecutor back then), was “complicit in the rape of Britain”, Mr Musk wrote; he mused about whether America should “liberate” the British people.

But the reaction to Mr Musk’s rant also reveals something about the prime minister and his principal political opponent. The most important biographical difference between Sir Keir and Kemi Badenoch, the new leader of the Conservative Party, is not that she was brought up in Nigeria and he in Surrey; nor even that he is a self-declared socialist and she a Thatcherite. It is that he came of age professionally before social media transformed politics, and she afterwards. British politics is now a contest between an offline prime minister and a very online leader of the opposition.

In 2004, two years before the launch of X (then Twitter), Michael Goldhaber, an American thinker, published an essay arguing that the internet would produce a new type of human, just as printing had. _Homo typographicus_ would be followed by _Homo interneticus._ His “mentality significantly altered” by the effects of intense internet use, _interneticus_ would be unmoored from time and space, disrespectful of old sources of authority and facing a constant battle for his attention.
