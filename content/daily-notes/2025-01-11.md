Great article by Anthropic cutting through the bullshit and hype of AI agents.

> "Agent" can be defined in several ways. Some customers define agents as fully autonomous systems that operate independently over extended periods, using various tools to accomplish complex tasks. Others use the term to describe more prescriptive implementations that follow predefined workflows. At Anthropic, we categorize all these variations as **agentic systems**, but draw an important architectural distinction between **workflows** and **agents**:
> 
> - **Workflows** are systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths.
> - **Agents**, on the other hand, are systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks.

#### Modern Internet Culture Seen Through The Lens of British Politics

>  
> In 2004, two years before the launch of X (then Twitter), Michael Goldhaber, an American thinker, published an essay arguing that the internet would produce a new type of human, just as printing had. _Homo typographicus_ would be followed by _Homo interneticus._ His “mentality significantly altered” by the effects of intense internet use, _interneticus_ would be unmoored from time and space, disrespectful of old sources of authority and facing a constant battle for his attention.

Found the original article: [The mentality of Homo interneticus: Some Ongian postulates | First Monday](https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1155)

In this comparision Keir Starmer is _typographicus_, and Kemi Badenoch is _interneticus_

> _Interneticus_, wrote Mr Goldhaber, would attach himself to new communities based on affinities “unshackled by space, unbounded by borders”. So the causes that most animate Ms Badenoch are litigated online and heavily influenced by America: gender identity; critical race theory; diversity, equity and inclusion schemes. She wants her party to think deeply about the civilisational questions the internet poses, such as the loss of presumption of innocence that emerges from online “pile-ons”.

…

> Sir Keir was baffled: had her party not been in power for 14 years, while reports into the abuse gathered dust? Why was she tweeting about it now? Yet, wrote Mr Goldhaber, the internet would erode notions of time, because unlike musty books which immediately betray their age, pixelated text is continually refreshed. _Interneticus_ would live in a “space devoid of chronological ordering…an ever-changing now”. And so the court judgments of over a decade ago pinging round X seem as urgent as if they had been written yesterday.

…

> A decade ago another prime minister, David Cameron, crowed that his defeated rivals had tangled themselves in online debates: “Britain and Twitter—they’re not the same thing.” Or as Mr Goldhaber put it: “For _Homo interneticus,_ cyberspace is most of the real world, and the rest is an appendage of it.“

#### Oddly Influenced Podcast E1: Boundary Objects
[Oddly Influenced | Transcript: E1: Boundary Objects](https://podcast.oddly-influenced.dev/episodes/boundary-objects/transcript)

> Here’s the quick definition:  
> 1. People collaborating on projects can be divided into groups (“social worlds”, in the jargon). Think of testers and programmers on a software project.  
> 2. Those groups have different values, goals, ways of looking at their jobs. Yet they are collaborating to accomplish one single thing in the world.  
> 3. One way to organize collaboration is to highlight certain words or things – those are the boundary objects, so-called because they lie at the boundaries between social worlds.  
> 4. These boundary objects are a bit delicate because they have to accomplish two things at once.  
> 4.1. When people from different social worlds use a boundary object with each other , they have to agree that they’re talking about the same thing, yet…  
> 4.2. The different interpretations they give to that word have to be flexible enough that they don’t cause arguments, wasted time, and so on.

…

> “Social worlds” is a term of art in sociology, one that I didn’t find a good definition of. But it goes something like this:
> 
> Humans are social animals who talk to each other. You and I perceive the world, but we interpret the photons that strike our eyeballs in the light of previous social interactions. It’s people around us who tell us what to value, how to value it: what’s interesting, what’s boring; what to pay attention to, and what to pretend doesn’t exist; what has *meaning* and what doesn’t.
> 
> Differing social worlds is what makes it possible for two entirely sincere people to interpret the same event in not just opposing but in seemingly completely disconnected ways.
> 
> So how is it that the collector and scientist collaborated to produce something whose value lasted a century? The answer the paper gives is that they use *boundary objects* to help them coordinate.

#### Close Readings: Marcus Aurelius
This is a great podcast about Marcus Aurelius’ book  _The Meditations_ and it's timeless appeal. #books #stoicism

This specific portion of the podcast transcript appealed to me a lot:

> Thomas Jones: And as for the longer term legacy of Marcus' thought and writings that _The Meditations_ are still quite widely read and quoted, perhaps more quoted than read. Claire Hall in a [recent piece on Galen for the LRB](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v46/n06/claire-hall/the-cook-always-wins) began by saying that Galen couldn't stand gym bros. Marcus' teachings are popular with tech bros. What is it about them that seems to appeal so much to a certain kind of modern man?
> 
> Emily WIlson: It's so funny, isn't it? I mean, the Silicon Valley version of stoicism seems to get more and more popular. And, of course, the fact that we've emphasized this is a self help for someone in a position of enormous privilege, which doesn't ask you to interrogate your privilege and instead sort of leans into it where you were born to be a leader and you can be even more leaderish and even more of a bro boss if you do a tiny bit or you don't even have to read very much of it. Just spend 5 minutes reading because it's also the kind of book that you can get a little bit out of and get most of the gist of it with 5 minutes of reading labor. So I think there are many reasons why it's as popular as it is, especially with the tech bros, but not just with them.
> 
> Right? I mean, it's striking to me that, you know, I've been teaching at university level for decades, and Marcus Aurelius is not usually part of the university syllabus in most places. And yet, I've looked up some various bestseller lists, and it's always almost at the top, and it's always sort of in the top 500 of all books on Amazon. It's extraordinarily best selling nowadays, which means it's not just Elon Musk who's reading it or buying it at least even if he's not reading it. It's a lot of people who are buying it and thinking this is going to give them some kind of insight into how to live.
> 
> And, of course, the fact that it does dig into things that we all wrestle with about fear of death and other people and how do we deal with with change and the temptation to be furious or annoyed all the time. Those are relatable issues even if the actual lived experience of Marcus Aurelius was not not relatable whatsoever because most people are not Roman emperors.
> 
> Thomas Jones: But also that he'd lived through a a pandemic and economic collapse and these things. So there are ways even though he'd not lived in the
> 
> Emily WIlson: So times of huge change. Yes. So stoicism is a philosophy for times of huge social upheaval and change and for people who are experiencing lack of political power and anger and lack of agency. As a result, it gives you that sense of agency in a time where you feel you don't have any. And that also suggests why is it appealing to people who don't have power as well as those who do.
> 
> Thomas Jones: Yeah. And sometimes in in tweet length bites.
> 
> Emily Wilson: Exactly. Yes. Yeah. In fact, I don't know if there's a moxiebelius spot, but there should be. I mean, it seems like it's made for that.

> This book takes place in a transitional time. I mean, quite literally, like, perimenopause is a big, huge biological time of transition. If you think of puberty, we know that biological things are happening, but we never just think of those things. We think romance, like every song on the radio in some ways, is about that time or about this certain kind of love.
> 
> And I remember thinking, oh, every love story is a hormone story. And so what is the love story for this time of transition? What is this hormone story of perimenopause? And to know that you don't just need to know the facts from your doctor, which would be nice. We would appreciate that. But also, what is the story? In what way are you supposed to fall in love during this time?
> 
> Because it's a wild time. Some part of yourself is going to come out that has perhaps been starved before. And this moment when all your hormones are in transition, you're meant now to be sort of jumbled around enough inside that that blind spot comes forward and it's hungry.

#### Cal Newport on X
Link: [7 Habits To Make 2025 Your Best Year Yet | Cal Newport - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ-sHGf2-uw) #twitter #x

Cal Newport had some very insightful thoughts on a podcast while answering a reader question.

> With over 200 million followers, Musk has the biggest account on X and increasingly uses it to wield political power. Look at this thing. In 26 days around the election, Musk fired off 3,870 posts that had more than 33 billion views. My God! If I was a shareholder in one of these companies, I'd be like, "What are you doing? Come on!" These 3,870 posts could have been like, "Are you thinking about our company?" Musk's reach transcends Trump's, with each of his posts typically seen by twice as many users as posts from the president-elect. As the post returns to Twitter, Trump's influence is smaller on there. As Musk prepares for a central role in the U.S. government, the billionaire has a political megaphone unmatched in modern society.
> 
> X, Twitter, whatever you want to call it, really is a playground of elites in a very broad sense. It was a place where intellectual, academic, technocratic, and political elites gathered, hashed out ideas, sought status, and collaboratively worked with each other to try to establish cultural Overton windows. So it was an important place for various elites. Most people in the country could care less. It's not a heavily used platform. It doesn't have a large number of active users. It doesn't play a large role in most people's day-to-day life. It's the smallest of the platforms in terms of usage. It's dwarfed by something like Facebook. That's why it was valued so little. That's why it was like a $40 billion company, whereas Meta is honing in on a trillion-dollar valuation. Whatever it is, $800 billion valuation—it's a pretty small company. But the people who write about it are part of that category of cultural elites to which it made a really big deal. So if you're covering technology, it's a really big deal. This was the clubhouse where we all were.
> 
> There was a change in fortune as the ownership of that clubhouse changed. The clubhouse became different. It was like a bigger kid took over the treehouse and put up a "No Girls Allowed" sign, like you would have had back when you were in fourth grade. The cultural-political equivalent of that is that the composition changed. There was a period in the lead-up to the last Donald Trump presidency and through the Biden presidency, up through Elon taking over Twitter, where certain groups sort of had control within these elites. Then it switched to like the other team got control of it, and this was very traumatic if you were someone who was hanging out in this clubhouse. But for the rest of the country, I don't think it mattered much. It did set the agenda for what elites wrote about, what other elites talked about. Elite politicians would look at what was happening on here, and this would set their agenda about how they thought about things or how they were reacting to things.
> 
> I think it was good for our culture at large that Elon Musk bought and semi-broke this platform because it reduces its influence on those cultural elites. Great fracture! It makes it more partisan, so its influence goes down. If it's more nakedly like, "This team has it; this team doesn't," its impact on how a politician thinks about what matters goes down. Its impact on how a journalist thinks about what they're going to write about or not write about goes down. Its impact on an academic trying to think about what they want to say or not say or pursue goes down. And that's for the good because it's entirely non-representative. It doesn't represent any sort of coherent understanding of the world. It's status-seeking elites from different sides all fighting with each other. Because, I guess if you do a little bit of math, 33 billion views with 3,870 posts would be about 8.5 million views per post, which I guess if you compare it to 335 million people in the U.S., it's only like—it's less than 3%. And it's the same people. That's the whole problem.
> 
> The problem is it didn't fall apart. Early on, there was this accusation of, "Look, when Musk took this over and started firing all these people, the platform itself technically was going to fall apart." I'd be like, "That would be great from my perspective as a cultural critic because this is not a useful contribution to our culture." The problem is Elon Musk is good at running tech companies, and he knows what he's doing. He fired a ton of people, brought in some 10xers, drastically cut down the expenses of running it, and you know what? It's perfectly stable again, and he's building. So that's the problem. He's too good at running companies to accidentally break it. But now it's just become like a smaller playhouse. There are these two sides fighting on there now. It's mainly just this side, and I don't think it's culturally important.

#### Dynamic variables in bash

> Dynamic shell variables allow shell scripts to define and access variables based on runtime conditions. Variable indirection (`${!var}` syntax) lets you reference the value of a variable through another variable. This can be useful for managing environment-specific configurations and function dispatch mechanisms.

Here’s an example:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# script.sh

config_path="/etc/config"
var="config_path"

echo "The value of \$config_path is: ${!var}"
```

```txt
The value of $config_path is: /etc/config
```

Here, `${!var}` resolves to the value of the variable `config_path` because `var` contains its name. This allows you to dynamically decide which variable to reference at runtime.
