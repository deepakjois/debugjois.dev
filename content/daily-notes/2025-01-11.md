Great article by Anthropic cutting through the bullshit and hype of AI agents.

> "Agent" can be defined in several ways. Some customers define agents as fully autonomous systems that operate independently over extended periods, using various tools to accomplish complex tasks. Others use the term to describe more prescriptive implementations that follow predefined workflows. At Anthropic, we categorize all these variations as **agentic systems**, but draw an important architectural distinction between **workflows** and **agents**:
> 
> - **Workflows** are systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths.
> - **Agents**, on the other hand, are systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks.

#### Modern Internet Culture Seen Through The Lens of British Politics

>  
> In 2004, two years before the launch of X (then Twitter), Michael Goldhaber, an American thinker, published an essay arguing that the internet would produce a new type of human, just as printing had. _Homo typographicus_ would be followed by _Homo interneticus._ His “mentality significantly altered” by the effects of intense internet use, _interneticus_ would be unmoored from time and space, disrespectful of old sources of authority and facing a constant battle for his attention.

Found the original article: [The mentality of Homo interneticus: Some Ongian postulates | First Monday](https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1155)

In this comparision Keir Starmer is _typographicus_, and Kemi Badenoch is _interneticus_

> _Interneticus_, wrote Mr Goldhaber, would attach himself to new communities based on affinities “unshackled by space, unbounded by borders”. So the causes that most animate Ms Badenoch are litigated online and heavily influenced by America: gender identity; critical race theory; diversity, equity and inclusion schemes. She wants her party to think deeply about the civilisational questions the internet poses, such as the loss of presumption of innocence that emerges from online “pile-ons”.

…

> Sir Keir was baffled: had her party not been in power for 14 years, while reports into the abuse gathered dust? Why was she tweeting about it now? Yet, wrote Mr Goldhaber, the internet would erode notions of time, because unlike musty books which immediately betray their age, pixelated text is continually refreshed. _Interneticus_ would live in a “space devoid of chronological ordering…an ever-changing now”. And so the court judgments of over a decade ago pinging round X seem as urgent as if they had been written yesterday.

…

> A decade ago another prime minister, David Cameron, crowed that his defeated rivals had tangled themselves in online debates: “Britain and Twitter—they’re not the same thing.” Or as Mr Goldhaber put it: “For _Homo interneticus,_ cyberspace is most of the real world, and the rest is an appendage of it.“

#### Oddly Influenced Podcast E1: Boundary Objects
[Oddly Influenced | Transcript: E1: Boundary Objects](https://podcast.oddly-influenced.dev/episodes/boundary-objects/transcript)

> Here’s the quick definition:  
> 1. People collaborating on projects can be divided into groups (“social worlds”, in the jargon). Think of testers and programmers on a software project.  
> 2. Those groups have different values, goals, ways of looking at their jobs. Yet they are collaborating to accomplish one single thing in the world.  
> 3. One way to organize collaboration is to highlight certain words or things – those are the boundary objects, so-called because they lie at the boundaries between social worlds.  
> 4. These boundary objects are a bit delicate because they have to accomplish two things at once.  
> 4.1. When people from different social worlds use a boundary object with each other , they have to agree that they’re talking about the same thing, yet…  
> 4.2. The different interpretations they give to that word have to be flexible enough that they don’t cause arguments, wasted time, and so on.

…

> “Social worlds” is a term of art in sociology, one that I didn’t find a good definition of. But it goes something like this:
> 
> Humans are social animals who talk to each other. You and I perceive the world, but we interpret the photons that strike our eyeballs in the light of previous social interactions. It’s people around us who tell us what to value, how to value it: what’s interesting, what’s boring; what to pay attention to, and what to pretend doesn’t exist; what has *meaning* and what doesn’t.
> 
> Differing social worlds is what makes it possible for two entirely sincere people to interpret the same event in not just opposing but in seemingly completely disconnected ways.
> 
> So how is it that the collector and scientist collaborated to produce something whose value lasted a century? The answer the paper gives is that they use *boundary objects* to help them coordinate.

#### Close Readings: Marcus Aurelius
This is a great podcast about Marcus Aurelius’ book  _The Meditations_ and it's timeless appeal. #books #stoicism

This specific portion of the podcast transcript appealed to me a lot:

> Thomas Jones: And as for the longer term legacy of Marcus' thought and writings that _The Meditations_ are still quite widely read and quoted, perhaps more quoted than read. Claire Hall in a [recent piece on Galen for the LRB](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v46/n06/claire-hall/the-cook-always-wins) began by saying that Galen couldn't stand gym bros. Marcus' teachings are popular with tech bros. What is it about them that seems to appeal so much to a certain kind of modern man?
> 
> Emily WIlson: It's so funny, isn't it? I mean, the Silicon Valley version of stoicism seems to get more and more popular. And, of course, the fact that we've emphasized this is a self help for someone in a position of enormous privilege, which doesn't ask you to interrogate your privilege and instead sort of leans into it where you were born to be a leader and you can be even more leaderish and even more of a bro boss if you do a tiny bit or you don't even have to read very much of it. Just spend 5 minutes reading because it's also the kind of book that you can get a little bit out of and get most of the gist of it with 5 minutes of reading labor. So I think there are many reasons why it's as popular as it is, especially with the tech bros, but not just with them.
> 
> Right? I mean, it's striking to me that, you know, I've been teaching at university level for decades, and Marcus Aurelius is not usually part of the university syllabus in most places. And yet, I've looked up some various bestseller lists, and it's always almost at the top, and it's always sort of in the top 500 of all books on Amazon. It's extraordinarily best selling nowadays, which means it's not just Elon Musk who's reading it or buying it at least even if he's not reading it. It's a lot of people who are buying it and thinking this is going to give them some kind of insight into how to live.
> 
> And, of course, the fact that it does dig into things that we all wrestle with about fear of death and other people and how do we deal with with change and the temptation to be furious or annoyed all the time. Those are relatable issues even if the actual lived experience of Marcus Aurelius was not not relatable whatsoever because most people are not Roman emperors.
> 
> Thomas Jones: But also that he'd lived through a a pandemic and economic collapse and these things. So there are ways even though he'd not lived in the
> 
> Emily WIlson: So times of huge change. Yes. So stoicism is a philosophy for times of huge social upheaval and change and for people who are experiencing lack of political power and anger and lack of agency. As a result, it gives you that sense of agency in a time where you feel you don't have any. And that also suggests why is it appealing to people who don't have power as well as those who do.
> 
> Thomas Jones: Yeah. And sometimes in in tweet length bites.
> 
> Emily Wilson: Exactly. Yes. Yeah. In fact, I don't know if there's a moxiebelius spot, but there should be. I mean, it seems like it's made for that.

#### Miranda July's All Fours on NPR Books Podcast
Link: [In 'All Fours,' Miranda July tackles love, sex and reinvention in middle age : NPR's Book of the Day : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/02/1222474632/nprs-book-of-the-day-miranda-july-all-fours)

This book takes place in a transitional time. I mean, quite literally, like, perimenopause

Speaker 3: Mhmm.

Speaker 1: Is a big, huge biological time of transition. If you think of puberty, we know that biological things are happening, but we never just think of those things. We think romance, like every song on the radio in some ways, is about that time or about this certain kind of love. And I remember thinking, oh, every love story is a hormone story. And so what is the love story for this time of transition?

What is this hormone story of perimenopause? And to know that you don't just need to know the facts from your doctor, which would be nice. We would appreciate that. But also, what is the story? In what way are you supposed to fall in love during this time?

Because it's a wild time. Some part of yourself is going to come out that has perhaps been starved before. And this moment when all your hormones are in transition, you're meant now to be sort of jumbled around enough inside that that blind spot comes forward and it's hungry. For this book, you talk to

Speaker 3: loads of people, middle aged women, women who have been middle aged, and doctors and researchers about menopause. Were there any particular ideas that felt really sticky to you around how you could reimagine middle age? Like, anything that anybody said to you that kind of launched you into a certain direction or certain path?

Speaker 1: Well, it was always interesting because you're kind of worried when you, like, get on the phone to do an interview about perimenopause and menopause with, like, let's say a woman in her sixties or seventies. And I was just so struck by the riches I was getting. Like, I started to feel like I was sitting on this gold mine, and I just wanted everyone to know, like, this is all really weird and alive. Mhmm. Not to say it's easy, but then there isn't really an easy part of life.

Right? The thing that makes it easy is these conversations easier. And it was kind of like some monster evaporated through knowledge, and in its place was just this kind of high feeling. I remember one woman described to me some some, like, sad things about aging and I nervously said, how bad is it? Is it unendurable?

And she said, I'm here for the body experience. And part of that is loss. And so I want it all. And the way she said it was just so true. I was, like, right.

I'm here for the body experience also. The body experience.

Speaker 3: Oh, that's a good that's a good one.

Speaker 1: And that's desire and that's lust, but that's also loss. And I I realized, like, oh, the loss is mine too. Like, I get to write with that. I get to love with it in my relationships. Like, it's not like a dead empty embarrassing thing.

It's it's alive too. It's power too.
