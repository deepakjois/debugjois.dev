#### Stoicism and the manosphere

> Critics have paid special attention to Holiday’s fans in Silicon Valley and in various online communities devoted to misogyny or racism or — usually — both. The classicist Donna Zuckerberg drew attention to this convergence in her 2018 book _Not All Dead White Men_, in which she argued that “the men of the manosphere have a deep fascination with Stoic philosophy.” Evidence of Stoicism’s popularity among right-wing extremists has only mounted since. The far-right influencer and alleged human trafficker Andrew Tate fashions himself a Stoic apostle; as he says in one video shared by the Instagram account @kngstoic, “you’re born to suffer, which ties back into my whole crypto project.” Holiday, for his part, has called Tate “repulsive” and suggested followers turn to Marcus Aurelius instead. Yet, as the classicist and _Meditations_ translator Gregory Hays has noted, Stoicism thrived among elite Roman men, staunch believers in the necessity of social hierarchy, and when Holiday says things like “obeisance is the way forward,” it is not hard to imagine the dark places to which such maxims might lead.

#### Edible Insects
[Exploring Insects as the Future of Food — GOYA](https://www.goya.in/blog/edible-insects-cambodian-food-a-crunchy-look-at-tomorrows-protein)

> It was 2013 when the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations published a [report](https://www.fao.org/4/i3253e/i3253e.pdf) titled ‘_Edible Insects: Future Prospects of Insects as Food and Feed’_. The report predicted that by 2050, the planet would be home to nine billion people. To address the food and nutrition challenges of today — nearly 1 billion people are chronically hungry worldwide — it is clear that what we eat and how we produce it must be re-evaluated.

> A few months ago, popular internet personality and author, Krish Ashok (who goes by [@_masalalab](https://www.instagram.com/_masalalab/) on Instagram and X) shared a detailed [video](https://www.instagram.com/_masalalab/reel/C8ChdTdNIpw/?hl=el) on the concept of eating insects. In his video, he explained how the process of cooking eliminates all potential germs and parasites inside insects. Last December, at Goa’s Serendipity Arts Festival, Tansha Vohra of the [Boochi Project](https://www.tanshavohra.com/boochi) explored the idea of insect eating by serving up weaver ants, crickets and mealworms at a food lab (below), during her session ‘_Imagining Insects—Rethinking Taste, Disgust and Delight’_.

#### A Sommelier’s Field Notes to the World of Matcha

> The Japanese tea tradition resists simplistic classification systems. Terms like ceremonial, imperial and culinary provide accessible entry points for consumers. Here’s a handy guide to distinguish between the three.

These classification systems are largely marketing, and to an extent simplified education for ordinary matcha consumers. For influencer obsessed matcha consumers out there who are more interested in mixing their matcha with other trendy interesting flavors, and having it with like a milk base - it doesnt really matter if your matcha is "ceremonial" grade. So please stop obsessing over it.

#### Is Having a Boyfriend Embarrassing Now?

> So, what gives? Are people embarrassed by their boyfriends now? Or is something more complicated going on? To me, it feels like the result of women wanting to straddle two worlds: one where they can receive the social benefits of having a partner, but also not appear so boyfriend-obsessed that they come across as quite culturally loser-ish. “They want the prize and celebration of partnership, but understand the norminess of it,” says Zoé Samudzi, writer and activist. In other words, in an era of widespread [heterofatalism](https://archive.ph/o/isEJL/https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/21/magazine/men-heterofatalism-dating-relationships.html), women don’t want to be seen as being all about their man, but they also want the clout that comes with being partnered.

I honestly wonder who these people are that the author is talking about. I only seem to run into them in the pages of a magazine like this one, nowhere else 🤷🏽‍♂️. 

#### Books and Loneliness
[Chapter 2: prioritize your favorite people - by Ava](https://www.avabear.xyz/p/chapter-2-prioritize-your-favorite) #friendship #loneliness #connection

This paragraph from Ava's latest was very relatable. The rest of the post is pretty awesome as well.

> I read compulsively because I was so lonely. My primary experience of connection my entire childhood was through consuming fiction. I have never wavered from the habit—I’ve always believed helplessly in life on the page. It was only through digesting consciousness this way that I was able to learn how to connect with other people. Because books convinced me that there were many people out there who had very rich and interesting interior lives, even currently if I wasn’t able to access them. It wasn’t inherently a hopeless situation: I was sure that connection was out there, even if I hadn’t found it yet. So the question became: how could I find it?

Oh, and this is actually a great list
