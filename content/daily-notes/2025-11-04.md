#### Stoicism and the manosphere

> Critics have paid special attention to Holiday’s fans in Silicon Valley and in various online communities devoted to misogyny or racism or — usually — both. The classicist Donna Zuckerberg drew attention to this convergence in her 2018 book _Not All Dead White Men_, in which she argued that “the men of the manosphere have a deep fascination with Stoic philosophy.” Evidence of Stoicism’s popularity among right-wing extremists has only mounted since. The far-right influencer and alleged human trafficker Andrew Tate fashions himself a Stoic apostle; as he says in one video shared by the Instagram account @kngstoic, “you’re born to suffer, which ties back into my whole crypto project.” Holiday, for his part, has called Tate “repulsive” and suggested followers turn to Marcus Aurelius instead. Yet, as the classicist and _Meditations_ translator Gregory Hays has noted, Stoicism thrived among elite Roman men, staunch believers in the necessity of social hierarchy, and when Holiday says things like “obeisance is the way forward,” it is not hard to imagine the dark places to which such maxims might lead.

> It was 2013 when the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations published a [report](https://www.fao.org/4/i3253e/i3253e.pdf) titled ‘_Edible Insects: Future Prospects of Insects as Food and Feed’_. The report predicted that by 2050, the planet would be home to nine billion people. To address the food and nutrition challenges of today — nearly 1 billion people are chronically hungry worldwide — it is clear that what we eat and how we produce it must be re-evaluated.

> A few months ago, popular internet personality and author, Krish Ashok (who goes by [@_masalalab](https://www.instagram.com/_masalalab/) on Instagram and X) shared a detailed [video](https://www.instagram.com/_masalalab/reel/C8ChdTdNIpw/?hl=el) on the concept of eating insects. In his video, he explained how the process of cooking eliminates all potential germs and parasites inside insects. Last December, at Goa’s Serendipity Arts Festival, Tansha Vohra of the [Boochi Project](https://www.tanshavohra.com/boochi) explored the idea of insect eating by serving up weaver ants, crickets and mealworms at a food lab (below), during her session ‘_Imagining Insects—Rethinking Taste, Disgust and Delight’_.
