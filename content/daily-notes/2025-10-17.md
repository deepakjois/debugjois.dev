Cory Doctorow at his humourous best

> Some bubbles leave nothing or next-to-nothing behind. Enron left nothing behind but the cooling corpse of a CEO who popped his clogs before he could be sentenced to life in prison. Worldcom left behind a CEO who survived long enough to die behind bars…and a ton of fiber in the ground that people are _still_ getting use out of (I'm sending these keystrokes to the internet on old Worldcom fiber that AT&T bought and lit up).

> Crypto's not going to leave much behind: a few Rust programmers who've really taken security by design to heart, sure, but mostly it'll be shitty Austrian economics and even shittier JPEGs.

> So what kind of bubble is AI? That's the $2 trillion question
