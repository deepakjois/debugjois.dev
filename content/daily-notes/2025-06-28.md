#### Peter Steinberger - Building Apps with AI
[Slot Machines for Programmers: How Peter Builds Apps 20x Faster with AI \| Peter Steinberger](https://steipete.me/posts/2025/when-ai-meets-madness-peters-16-hour-days) #ai #programming 
Peter built vibetunnel with two other people: [GitHub - amantus-ai/vibetunnel: Turn any browser into your terminal & command your agents on the go.](https://github.com/amantus-ai/vibetunnel)

The process was heavily AI assisted and the post above goes into his thoughts around using AI. It's more credible when folks who have actually built something useful that's in the wild and works well talk about AI assited coding.

> Here’s where things get spicy. While the internet is flooded with “10 AMAZING PROMPTING TRICKS THAT WILL BLOW YOUR MIND” listicles, Peter has a refreshingly blunt take:
> 
> This is the greatest bullshit. There are so many people out there that try to explain you… All those long websites about prompting… That’s all bullshit.
> 
> Instead, Peter’s secret sauce is beautifully simple: explain what you want from multiple angles, like you’re talking to someone slightly unfamiliar with your product. No structure needed. Just ramble.
> 
> Sometimes my prompt is this long where it’s a lot of rambling. Oh yeah. The padding… looks like shit. It needs to be like this and this and this.
> 
> He uses [WisprFlow](https://wisprflow.ai/). “Heck, they should give me affiliate links by now because I converted so many people.”
> 
> Crucial insight:
> 
> They’re non-predictable. It’s like nature. So if you don’t like the outcome, just try it again.
> 
> Agents have “temperature.” Don’t like the result? Just re-execute without changing the prompt. Like slot machines: press enter, get something new.
> 
> Peter’s approach leverages something most don’t realize: we _like_ redundancy. Explain the same thing three ways, we don’t get annoyed. We get clarity.


> **The Real Skill: Clear Thinking**

> When Peter starts something fresh, he has a [bulletproof SDD workflow](https://steipete.me/posts/2025/understanding-codebases-with-ai-gemini-workflow/) using Google AI Studio: brain dump ideas into a 500-line Software Design Document, iterate with “Take this SDD apart” prompts for 3-5 rounds until the spec is bulletproof, then simply tell Claude Code: “Build spec.md” and let it run for a few hours.
