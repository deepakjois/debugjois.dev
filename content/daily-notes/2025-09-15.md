#### AGI Skepticism

Imagine my (utter lack of) surprise to see this same dynamic take hold of the AI industry. Every day, I watch the following Types of Guy post benchmark results that show LLMs going straight up and to the right in performance:

1. **Founders** who have untold billions at stake in a contract clause that triggers when they reach AGI. (Ok, maybe just one founder. And his investors and assorted dependents and hangers on.)
2. **Patriots** who want to warn that America is behind in the race to AGI.
3. **Mercenaries** (investors, engineers) who are arm-in-arm with the aforementioned patriots, because they want to dip their beak in some of the governent money that will flow towards efforts to beat China to AGI.
4. **X-risk Doomers** who sincerely believe that AGI will kill us all, therefore we need to enact shockingly illiberal, draconian global measures (which they have come up with and would be in charge of) to stop it.
5. **E/accs** who sincerely believe that AGI will usher in a literal post-biological utopia, free of suffering and death, and the rest of Samsara.
6. **Threadbois** who farm engagement.

I’m sure I’ve missed a few with this list, but you get the idea. There is a _lot_ at stake in “AI number go up” discourse, both financially and spiritually (i.e., national pride, of either summoning all-powerful daemons or preventing the summoning of all-powerful demons).
