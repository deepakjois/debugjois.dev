- [082 - Thinking Beyond the Brain: Exploring the "Extended Mind" (Part 2) | Listen Notes](https://lnns.co/QXjIFWRotw5) #fitness #brain - The core idea of this series of episodes on the book _Extended Mind_ is that - what we consider our thinking mind, isnt just locked inside our brains, but is actively influenced by our body and our environment. A lot of common advice to live well, like exercise, being in nature etc follows from that.

Not a ton of new stuff that I otherwise haven't heard before, and this was essentially an avenue to promote his new book _Meditation for Mortals_. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it as always.

#### Debrid
A random conversation at 3W cafe with Cyril introduced me to the magical world of [Stremio](https://www.stremio.com/) and Debrid servers to watch popular media online.

To set some context, my current media consumption workflow is quite effective, but a bit bespoke and clunky. It essentially involves:
- A seedbox hosted at [Seedgator](https://seedgator.com/)
- 1337x to search for torrents[1337x | Free Movies, TV Series, Music, Games and Software](https://1337x-to.pages.dev/)
- nzbgeek to search usenet forum downloads: [Geek](https://nzbgeek.info)
- rtorrent for torrent downloads: [GitHub - rakshasa/rtorrent: rTorrent BitTorrent client](https://github.com/rakshasa/rtorrent)
- sabnzbd to download stuff from usenet forums: [SABnzbd - The free and easy binary newsreader](https://sabnzbd.org/)
- and finally a duct-taped script that uses wget and fzf to choose and download the files from the seedbox on to a PC connected to my TV.

Enter [Stremio](https://www.stremio.com/), [Torrentio - Stremio Addon](https://torrentio.strem.fun/configure) and 

Here's an explanation of the simplified flow:
1. The user selects media to watch in Stremio.
2. Stremio queries its addons for available sources.
3. The Torrentio addon searches for torrents of the requested media.
4. Torrentio sends the magnet link to a Debrid service.
5. The Debrid service downloads the torrent to its cloud servers.
6. Debrid creates a streamable link from the downloaded content.
7. This streamable link is sent back to Stremio.
8. The user can then stream the media directly through Stremio.
