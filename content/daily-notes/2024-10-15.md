A lot of common advice to live well, like exercise, being in nature etc follows from that.

Not a ton of new stuff that I otherwise haven't heard before, and this was essentially an avenue to promote his new book _Meditation for Mortals_. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it as always.

#### Debrid
A random conversation at 3W cafe with Cyril introduced me to the magical world of [Stremio](https://www.stremio.com/) and Debrid servers to watch popular media online.

To set some context, my current media consumption workflow is quite effective, but a bit bespoke and clunky. It essentially involves:
- A seedbox hosted at [Seedgator](https://seedgator.com/)
- 1337x to search for torrents[1337x | Free Movies, TV Series, Music, Games and Software](https://1337x-to.pages.dev/)
- nzbgeek to search usenet forum downloads: [Geek](https://nzbgeek.info)
- rtorrent for torrent downloads: [GitHub - rakshasa/rtorrent: rTorrent BitTorrent client](https://github.com/rakshasa/rtorrent)
- sabnzbd to download stuff from usenet forums: [SABnzbd - The free and easy binary newsreader](https://sabnzbd.org/)
- and finally a duct-taped script that uses wget and fzf to choose and download the files from the seedbox on to a PC connected to my TV.

Enter debrid servers into the picture. Here is a nice definition from [GitHub - debridmediamanager/awesome-debrid: ðŸ†“ Download and stream in an instant](https://github.com/debridmediamanager/awesome-debrid)

**Before:**Â Debrid services are web apps that provide premium access to multiple file hosts (or one-click hosters, OCH). This enables users to download or stream content from various sources through a single account, often at higher speeds and with fewer restrictions. They are also referred to as multi one-click hosters (MOCH).

**Now:**Â Apart from being able to download from OCH, Debrid services are becoming more and more popular lately because of being able to instantly finish downloading a torrent and providing an HTTPS (!) link to download or stream a video inside it. The concept is similar to a shared torrentÂ [seedbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seedbox)Â although not all Debrid services support seeding. The difference of this andÂ [Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet)Â is with a Debrid service, you don't need a different software toÂ [download](https://nzbget.net/)Â content and it supports streaming a la Netflix. Other Debrid services like Real-Debrid also supports video transcoding without any additional fees.

Downloading via a HTTPS link with a Debrid service provides enhanced security, as the encryption of the download URL ensures that the specifics of what you are downloading remain hidden from anyone monitoring the network. A VPN is not required unless the website is compromised for aÂ [man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack).

In the cafe conversation with Cyril, I found about the combination of [Stremio](https://www.stremio.com/), the [Torrentio - Stremio Addon](https://torrentio.strem.fun/configure) and [Real-Debrid: All-in-one solution](https://real-debrid.com/). There is a guide on reddit that provides dead simple instructions to set it up: [Reddit - Dive into anything](https://www.reddit.com/r/StremioAddons/comments/15agu2p/stremio_torrentio_debrid_a_howto_guide/)

Here's an explanation of the simplified flow:
1. The user selects media to watch in Stremio.
2. Stremio queries its addons for available sources.
3. The Torrentio addon searches for torrents of the requested media.
4. Torrentio sends the magnet link to a Debrid service.
5. The Debrid service downloads the torrent to its cloud servers.
6. Debrid creates a streamable link from the downloaded content.
7. This streamable link is sent back to Stremio.
8. The user can then stream the media directly through Stremio.
