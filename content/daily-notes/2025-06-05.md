> Despite what the name might suggest, relationship anarchy (RA) – a term coined by writer Andie Nordgren in a 2012 Tumblr essay – is not a style of nonmonogamy where there are no rules, no commitment and you can do whatever you want at all times. You don’t even need to live in Portland or make your own kimchi to practice it. Instead, RA is a relationship style centred on the very reasonable belief that “no relationship should be bound by any rules not entirely agreed upon by the involved parties”, as Feeld puts it.
> 
> Unlike Relationship Stalinism, its arch-rival, RA promotes a non-hierarchical approach to relationships, so that romantic and sexual partners aren’t ranked more highly than each other, than platonic friends or family members. So if your besties are as important to you as your love life, you might just be a budding relationship anarchist. If, on the other hand, you veer wildly between insisting that your friends are _everything_ and chucking them off a bridge the second someone hot slides in your DMs, it might not be for you.
