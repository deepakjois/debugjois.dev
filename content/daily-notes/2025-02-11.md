#### How do radical ideas go mainstream
[How do Radical Ideas Go Mainstream?  - by Alice Evans](https://www.ggd.world/p/how-do-radical-ideas-go-mainstream) #feminism #radical

> Over the 1970s, Americans rapidly became much more supportive of gender equality. Departing from the cult of domesticity, families increasingly came to support equal rights at work and in politics, as well as the transformation of intimate relationships.
> 
> What enabled this remarkable shift?  
>   
> Most Americans encountered feminism indirectly, yet media coverage was overwhelmingly hostile. Mainstream news, like the New York Times, focused on outrageous protests and vilified feminists as rebellious extremists.
> 
> Some scholars point to ‘counter-publics’ - ‘feminist consciousness-raising’ in small groups, which problematised sexism and envisioned more egalitarian alternatives. Feminist newsletters and bookstores also gained popularity - at least in San Francisco. But how did radicalism spread beyond small activist circles to influence millions of Americans?
> 
> A tremendous new paper by [Francesca Polletta, Debra Boka, Caroline Martínez and Mutsumi Ogaki](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/734377) offers an answer which I had previously overlooked, but immediately found compelling. Women’s magazines like Ladies’ Home Journal and McCall’s made feminism _relatable_. And they reached a massive audience - 50 million plus. A single issue of McCall’s reached one in four American women! Bam.
