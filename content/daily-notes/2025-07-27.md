#### Why are we all so weird about cheating?

> Writer [Amanda Montei](https://substack.com/@amandamontei/p-153917470) highlighted the nonsensical ways we attempt to punish and scold those who have cheated in her essay on the film _Babygirl_ for her Substack newsletter, Mad Woman. She mentions that when Romy (Nicole Kidman) reveals her affair with Samuel (Harris Dickinson) to her husband, played by Antonio Banderas, he yells at her and asserts that she has jeopardised their children and kicks her out. Montei simply asks, “How exactly has she hurt her children?” By having the kind of sex she actually wants to have? By acting and living for herself and not her children or husband? These are very different situations, obviously, and I am not here to cast moral judgement on these behaviours. But why should someone be stripped of everything for behaving the “wrong” way?

#### Overtourism in Japan
[Overtourism in Japan, and How it Hurts Small Businesses — Ridgeline issue 210](https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/210/) #japan #tourism

> A great city is typified by _character_ and the character of great cities is often built on the bedrock of small businesses. Conversely: Chain shops smooth over the character of cities into anodyne nothingness. Think about a city you love — it’s likely because of walkability, greenery, great architecture, and fun local shops and restaurants. Only psychopaths love Manhattan because of Duane Reade. If you’ve ever wondered why overtourism can be a kind of death for parts of a city (the parts that involve: living there, commuting there, creating a life there) it’s because it paradoxically disincentivizes building small businesses.[1](https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/210/?utm_source=hackernewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=fav#fn:1) Nobody opens a tiny restaurant or café to be popular on a grand, viral scale. Nor do they open them to become rich.[2](https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/210/?utm_source=hackernewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=fav#fn:2)
> 
> So why _do_ people open small shops? For any number of reasons, but my favorite is: They have a strong opinion about how some aspect of a business should be run, and they want to double down on it. For example, forty years ago Terui-san, the owner of jazz _kissa_ Kaiunbashi-no-Johnny’s up in Morioka, was like: Hmm, nobody is spinning _wa-jyazu_ (Japanese jazz),[3](https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/210/?utm_source=hackernewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=fav#fn:3) so I’m _only_ going to rock it. That led to a bunch of cool knock-on connections, not the least of which was a lifelong friendship with the incredible [Akiyoshi Toshiko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toshiko_Akiyoshi). That singular _thing_ can drive an initial impulse, but small business purpose quickly shifts into: Being a community hub for a core group of regulars. That — community — is probably the biggest asset of small business ownership. And the quickest way to kill community (perhaps _the most valuable_ gift for running a small business) is to go viral in a damaging way.

> At risk of oversimplifying: Most “problems” in the world today boil down to scale and abstraction. As scale increases, individuals become more abstract, and humanity and empathy are lost. This happens acutely when the algorithm decides to laser-beam a small shop with a hundred-million views. If you cast a net to that many people, a vast chunk of them will not engage in good faith, let alone take a second to consider the feelings of residents or owners or why the place was built to begin with. Hence: The crush, the selfish crush.
> 
> Overtourism brings with it a corollary effect, what I call the “Disneyland flipflop.”[8](https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/210/?utm_source=hackernewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=fav#fn:8) This happens when visitors fail to see (willfully or not) the place they’re visiting as an _actual city_ with humans living and working and building lives there, but rather as a place flipflopped through the lens of social media into a Disneyland, one to be pillaged commercially, assumed to reset each night for their pleasure, welcoming their transient deluge with open arms. This is most readily evident in, say, the [Mario Kart scourge](https://unseen-japan.com/mario-kart-company-charged/) of Tokyo — perhaps one of the most breathtakingly universally-hated tourist activities. I dare you to find a resident who supports these idiots disrupting traffic as the megalopolis attempts to function around them.[9](https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/210/?utm_source=hackernewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=fav#fn:9)

> This overtourism is happening _mostly_ because of algorithms collimating the attention of the masses towards very specific activities / places. There’s also a slightly nutty narcissism / selfish component to it, too — fueling that impulse to, at all costs, “get” a photo at a specific spot to share on a specific social media service. (See: Fushimi Inari.) If the algorithm is the gas, cheapness is the spark. Because, damn, is it cheap to travel these days. Combined with the fact that there have never been more “middle class” people in the world, and you get overtourism. In a way, overtourism complications and disruptions are what happens when “humanity wins” and more people have more time and money to go “do things.”

> Because! Here’s the heartening bit: More people than ever are traveling, and while, sure, the majority of those travelers are just following trends and lists, there is another group, a small cohort of self-aware travelers who are genuinely, deeply curious about the places they’re visiting, who desire to engage directly without being disruptive, who want to engage fully and “authentically” (that is: visiting people and places that haven’t twisted themselves for the sake of transient visitors (i.e., no renaming things “samurai spice”)). And that “small cohort” (let’s say 15% of global travelers) is larger than the total number of travelers the world saw twenty years ago. Omotesando? Gion? They’re lost, like villages washed away by a tsunami. Much like I don’t understand the heart of a wave, I do not understand the hearts of those who come to Japan to buy a Rimowa suitcase. (Quite frankly, it really freaks me out!) And it is not our job to understand.

> These kinds of folks buoy the chest, elevate the soul (like witnessing a person stand on an escalator and just stare into the distance, refusing the Siren call of their smartphone). I don’t know if there’s some Platonic or deontic mode of travel, but in my opinion, the most rewarding _point_ of travelling is: to sit with, and spend time with The Other (even if the place / people aren’t all that different). To go off the beaten track a bit, just a bit, to challenge yourself, to find a nook of quietude, and to try to take home some goodness (a feeling, a moment) you might observe off in the wilds of Iwate or Aomori. That little bundle of goodness, filtered through your own cultural ideals — that’s good globalism at work. With an ultimate goal of doing all this without imposing on or overloading the locals. To being an additive part of the economy (financially and culturally), to commingling with regulars without displacing them.


#### algorithmic performativity
[algorithmic performativity - by Adam Aleksic](https://etymology.substack.com/p/algorithmic-performativity) #social-media #algorithms

> Chat, we all act differently when we’re being watched. There’s a pressure to avoid embarrassment, to present “authentically,” to put others at ease.
> 
> Sociologist Erving Goffman calls this _performance_—the idea that all public interactions are a kind of theatrical act. You’ll put on a different performance for your college friends and your grandmother; TV broadcasters will put on a different performance when on air and behind the scenes.
>
> In the same way, social media algorithms are uniquely changing how we present ourselves online, since they come with a completely new type of spectator: the algorithm itself.

#### how social media subjugates us
[how social media subjugates us - by Adam Aleksic](https://etymology.substack.com/p/how-social-media-subjugates-us) #social-media #dominance 

> Throughout this parasocial interaction, we’ve both adopted social roles that come with an imbued set of norms and behaviors. You, the viewer, are in an assigned role of docility. I, the influencer, am in an assigned role of dominance. With each repetition of this dance, we internalize our roles a little bit more. Even though I started out as some random guy yapping on the internet, my role over time is mutually legitimized and I begin to take on greater credibility in your mind.

> To be clear, I as an influencer also submit myself to the platform, much like a supplicant to a ruler. I need to replicate “viral-looking” mannerisms and expressions; I need to [perform for the algorithm](https://etymology.substack.com/p/algorithmic-performativity) by [submitting to its constraints](https://etymology.substack.com/p/the-perils-of-online-communication). My studio lighting and “influencer accent” are forms of aesthetic labor validating the platform’s priorities. Then you perceive my message on the toilet and do the same, and we both give more power to the technology mediating our interaction.
