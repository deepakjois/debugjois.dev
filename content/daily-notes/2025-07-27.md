#### Why are we all so weird about cheating?

> Writer [Amanda Montei](https://substack.com/@amandamontei/p-153917470) highlighted the nonsensical ways we attempt to punish and scold those who have cheated in her essay on the film _Babygirl_ for her Substack newsletter, Mad Woman. She mentions that when Romy (Nicole Kidman) reveals her affair with Samuel (Harris Dickinson) to her husband, played by Antonio Banderas, he yells at her and asserts that she has jeopardised their children and kicks her out. Montei simply asks, “How exactly has she hurt her children?” By having the kind of sex she actually wants to have? By acting and living for herself and not her children or husband? These are very different situations, obviously, and I am not here to cast moral judgement on these behaviours. But why should someone be stripped of everything for behaving the “wrong” way?

#### Overtourism in Japan
[Overtourism in Japan, and How it Hurts Small Businesses — Ridgeline issue 210](https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/210/) #japan #tourism

> A great city is typified by _character_ and the character of great cities is often built on the bedrock of small businesses. Conversely: Chain shops smooth over the character of cities into anodyne nothingness. Think about a city you love — it’s likely because of walkability, greenery, great architecture, and fun local shops and restaurants. Only psychopaths love Manhattan because of Duane Reade. If you’ve ever wondered why overtourism can be a kind of death for parts of a city (the parts that involve: living there, commuting there, creating a life there) it’s because it paradoxically disincentivizes building small businesses.[1](https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/210/?utm_source=hackernewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=fav#fn:1) Nobody opens a tiny restaurant or café to be popular on a grand, viral scale. Nor do they open them to become rich.[2](https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/210/?utm_source=hackernewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=fav#fn:2)

> So why _do_ people open small shops? For any number of reasons, but my favorite is: They have a strong opinion about how some aspect of a business should be run, and they want to double down on it. For example, forty years ago Terui-san, the owner of jazz _kissa_ Kaiunbashi-no-Johnny’s up in Morioka, was like: Hmm, nobody is spinning _wa-jyazu_ (Japanese jazz),[3](https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/210/?utm_source=hackernewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=fav#fn:3) so I’m _only_ going to rock it. That led to a bunch of cool knock-on connections, not the least of which was a lifelong friendship with the incredible [Akiyoshi Toshiko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toshiko_Akiyoshi). That singular _thing_ can drive an initial impulse, but small business purpose quickly shifts into: Being a community hub for a core group of regulars. That — community — is probably the biggest asset of small business ownership. And the quickest way to kill community (perhaps _the most valuable_ gift for running a small business) is to go viral in a damaging way.
