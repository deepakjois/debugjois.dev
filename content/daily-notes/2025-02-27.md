#### Podscript UI overhaul
[UI overhaul · deepakjois/podscript@ef94c87 · GitHub](https://github.com/deepakjois/podscript/commit/ef94c87b5f95a48dd94184a9a2b932786dec5225) #podscript #react #shadcn

Overhauled the Podscript web UI with close to 1000 lines of AI assisted React code that uses [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components.

I used Cursor heavily because my React foo is kinda rusty. However, I did get it to explain every line of code to me as a learning exercise. Along the way, I was able to prompt the AI to improve some of the code it generated, so I am gonna say it was a very collaborative endeavor.

#### Roti
[Community-Based Research Explores Roti’s Global Histories – SAPIENS](https://www.sapiens.org/culture/roti-collective-gender-histories-community/) #roti #food #history #culture

> _Kale roti_, for example, is a regional delicacy from Bangladesh that contains black gram beans (_mashkalai_) and other flours, and is eaten with mashed dishes made of chili, eggplant, tomato, or spiced beef. Using ingredients such as melted butter and cake flour changes the flatbread’s texture into the soft and spongy South African _butter roti._ In South Asia, Kenya, and Uganda, the flatbread goes by “chapati,” from the Urdu-Hindi root word “chapat” (slap), referring to the slapping technique used to flatten dough balls into thin, round discs before cooked on a _tawa_, or hot griddle. In Guyana, the name “clap roti” similarly points to a clapping technique for fashioning a flaky, tender roti—perfect for picking up steaming hot goat curry. In the Indian province of Gujarat, there is an extra-thin roti called a _rotli_. In Malaysia, the word “roti” can refer to many types of leavened and unleavened breads, including the famous _roti canai_, enjoyed as a circular, crunchy, flaky bread. And in various places, people have created versions to accommodate dietary restrictions and preferences, including vegan roti.

#### Slop
[The New Aesthetics of Slop - by Ted Gioia](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/the-new-aesthetics-of-slop) #ai #slop

> We have come a long way from the days of Impressionism and Naturalism and all the rest. Those were _serious_ movements. They happened because of dedicated artists committed to their craft.
> 
> Slop is the opposite.
> 
> It’s the perfect aesthetic theory for 12 year olds with no artistic sensitivty—but possessing a crude sense of humor and lots of pop culture detritus in their heads.
> 
> Tech companies embrace this—and even brag about the sloppiness of their Slop. Each generation of AI aspires to new levels of whackness.


> AI does not possess a self. It lacks personhood. It has no experience of subjectivity. So any art it creates will inevitably feel empty and hollow.

The Slop Manifesto is pretty cool!

#### How to code with Claude Sonnet 3.7
Some tips to code with Claude Code from somebody who works at Anthropic. #code #claude #ai #tools

> Catherine Olsson: Claude Code is very useful, but it can still get confused.
> 
> A few quick tips from my experience coding with it at Anthropic 👉
> 
> 1. Work from a clean commit so it's easy to reset all the changes. Often I want to back up and explain it from scratch a different way.
>     
> 2. Sometimes I work on two devboxes at the same time: one for me, one for Claude Code. We’re both trying ideas in parallel. E.g. Claude proposes a brilliant idea but stumbles on the implementation. Then I take the idea over to my devbox to write it myself.
>     
> 3. My most common confusion with Claude is when tests and code don't match, which one to change? Ideal to state clearly whether I'm writing novel tests for existing code I'm reasonably sure has the intended behavior, or writing novel code against tests that define the behavior.
>     
> 4. If we're working on something tricky and it keeps making the same mistakes, I keep track of what they were in a little notes file. Then when I clear the context or re-prompt, I can easily remind it not to make those mistakes.
>     
> 5. I can accidentally "climb up where I can't get down". E.g. I was working on code in Rust, which I do not know. The first few PRs went great! Then Claude was getting too confused. Oh no. We're stuck. IME this is fine, just get ready to slowww dowwwn to get properly oriented.
>     
> 6. When reviewing Claude-assisted PRs, look out for weirder misunderstandings than the human driver would make! We're all a little junior with this technology. There's more places where goofy misunderstandings and odd choices can leak in.

#### Beliefs about Groups
[Property Rights Part II: Groups Are All In Your Head](https://thelivingfossils.substack.com/p/property-rights-part-ii-groups-are) #groups #psychology 

> Consider the case of the Hutu and Tutsi. Before colonial powers arrived in Rwanda and Burundi, the distinction between Hutu and Tutsi was tied to roles: Tutsi were cattle herders, and Hutu were primarily farmers. These roles were malleable. A Hutu who gained wealth, for example, could become a Tutsi, and a Tutsi who fell into poverty might be seen as a Hutu. It wasn’t penguin-like. No genetic barrier separated the two; rather, it was a set of beliefs tied to social and economic status that people shared about who belonged where.
> 
> Then colonial powers showed up, bringing their own beliefs about human groups. The Belgians, looking for a tidy way to rule, assigned group membership based on external traits—height, nose shape, and skin tone—and issued identity cards that fixed people as either Hutu or Tutsi. What had been fluid became rigid, and what had been a matter of local belief became a matter of colonial administration. Suddenly, group membership wasn’t _just_ in people’s heads; it was on ID cards. But here’s the key: the colonial project worked the way it did because it created new beliefs. Hutu and Tutsi became fixed categories, not because DNA had changed but because the social world had.
> 
> This artificial rigidity had horrible consequences, which [echo to this day](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2025/01/28/rwanda-does-a-putin-in-congo). Once people’s beliefs about group membership hardened, so too did the lines of power and conflict. By the mid-20th century, these categories fueled violent struggles that culminated in the Rwandan Genocide. Even in the aftermath of such horror, the reality remained: the distinction between Hutu and Tutsi is still a matter of belief. Just as in the case of property rights—and moral rules as well—if no one believed the distinction mattered, it would vanish tomorrow. There is no penguin-like essential quality separating the two groups. Hutus and Tutsi are Hutus and Tutsis because someone interprets them as being such.
