#### Podscript UI overhaul
[UI overhaul · deepakjois/podscript@ef94c87 · GitHub](https://github.com/deepakjois/podscript/commit/ef94c87b5f95a48dd94184a9a2b932786dec5225) #podscript #react #shadcn

Overhauled the Podscript web UI with close to 1000 lines of AI assisted React code that uses [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components.

I used Cursor heavily because my React foo is kinda rusty. However, I did get it to explain every line of code to me as a learning exercise. Along the way, I was able to prompt the AI to improve some of the code it generated, so I am gonna say it was a very collaborative endeavor.
