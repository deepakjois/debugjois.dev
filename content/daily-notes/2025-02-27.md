#### Podscript UI overhaul
[UI overhaul · deepakjois/podscript@ef94c87 · GitHub](https://github.com/deepakjois/podscript/commit/ef94c87b5f95a48dd94184a9a2b932786dec5225) #podscript #react #shadcn

Overhauled the Podscript web UI with close to 1000 lines of AI assisted React code that uses [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components.

I used Cursor heavily because my React foo is kinda rusty. However, I did get it to explain every line of code to me as a learning exercise. Along the way, I was able to prompt the AI to improve some of the code it generated, so I am gonna say it was a very collaborative endeavor.

#### Roti

> _Kale roti_, for example, is a regional delicacy from Bangladesh that contains black gram beans (_mashkalai_) and other flours, and is eaten with mashed dishes made of chili, eggplant, tomato, or spiced beef. Using ingredients such as melted butter and cake flour changes the flatbread’s texture into the soft and spongy South African _butter roti._ In South Asia, Kenya, and Uganda, the flatbread goes by “chapati,” from the Urdu-Hindi root word “chapat” (slap), referring to the slapping technique used to flatten dough balls into thin, round discs before cooked on a _tawa_, or hot griddle. In Guyana, the name “clap roti” similarly points to a clapping technique for fashioning a flaky, tender roti—perfect for picking up steaming hot goat curry. In the Indian province of Gujarat, there is an extra-thin roti called a _rotli_. In Malaysia, the word “roti” can refer to many types of leavened and unleavened breads, including the famous _roti canai_, enjoyed as a circular, crunchy, flaky bread. And in various places, people have created versions to accommodate dietary restrictions and preferences, including vegan roti.
