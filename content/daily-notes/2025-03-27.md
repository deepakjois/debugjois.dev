Awesome read.

#### Non Monogamy
[Countering the Monogamy-Superiority Myth: A Meta-Analysis of the Differences in Relationship Satisfaction and Sexual Satisfaction as a Function of Relationship Orientation](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224499.2025.2462988?username=nicola_davis&_gl=1*rdysrl*_gcl_au*MTExNTkxMTM5MC4xNzQyOTAwNDU5*_ga*MTY0ODY4Nzk0LjE3NDI5MDA0NTg.*_ga_0HYE8YG0M6*MTc0MjkwMDQ1OC4xLjEuMTc0MjkwMDQ5Ny4yMi4wLjA.)

Found this paper in this Dazed article: [Non-monogamous relationships are ‘just as happy’ as monogamous ones | Dazed](https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/66464/1/non-monogamous-relationships-just-as-happy-polyamory-dating-romance)

I LOLed at this paragraph in the article:

> The flipside is that the research doesn’t find any consistent _benefits_ to opting out of monogamy either: perhaps surprisingly, people in non-monogamous relationships do not experience “significantly” higher levels of sexual satisfaction. Could this revelation dampen the envy and resentment which some monogamous people clearly feel towards people they assume to be having more sex than them? Could it be the beginning of a detente between two warring factions, who clearly have more in common than they realise? Maybe all relationships trend towards sibling-like companionship punctured by perfunctory bouts of missionary, regardless of how many partners you happen to have. Maybe the non-monogamous aren’t all sex-crazed libertines who live in communes and spend their time having drug-fuelled orgies and making their own kimchi, but human beings with ordinary desires and disappointments, just like you and me.
