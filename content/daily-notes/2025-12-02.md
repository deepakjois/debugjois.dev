#### The Cost of Living
I was sitting in a Copenhagen cafe ([Original Coffee Istegade](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2aEgmodDwEcNPTwn8) to be exact) and they had a stack of [Kinfolk](https://www.kinfolk.com/) magazines. I wanted to stay off any screens so I just started reading all the back issues one by one and stayed for the entire day. 

This article especially caught my attention: [The Cost of Living - Kinfolk](https://www.kinfolk.com/stories/the-cost-of-living/)

It's paywalled online and not availble in full. But here is a lovely quote from it.

> The essential problem is much the same now as it was then: What we _think_ we want, and what _actually_ makes us happy are, in the end, not the same things. Thoreau’s solution is surprisingly practical and has the tone of an economics lecture rather than the pulpit. “The cost of a thing,” he writes, “is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run.” 
> 
> When we devote ourselves to our jobs and push ourselves to acquire the outward signs of success, we often vastly under-estimate the amount of “life-cost” we will pay to attain our goals. Once awoken to this cost, Thoreau saw it everywhere: the effort made to dress elegantly, curry favor among neighbors and business associates, the fear of insolvency. At one point he notes that most of his neighbors would rather appear in public with a broken leg than with patched trousers (“distressed” garments had yet to come into fashion).

"life-cost" is such an amazing concept.
