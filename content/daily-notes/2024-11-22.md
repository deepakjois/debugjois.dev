This is a good bio of the man, with some funny one-liners.

#### Sex Lives of College Girls

S3 has landed and it is pretty much the same as the last two seasons in its occasionally crude humor and fast-paced dialogue. I can't say it's the best thing in TV right now, but I keep going back for some reason.

#### The Two Types of Human Laugh

> The findings, published this week in _Biology Letters_, are more than light entertainment. They could, instead, point scientists towards the evolutionary roots of laughter. After all, many mammals including dogs, squirrel monkeys, Barbary macaques and chimpanzees produce vocalisations during play that sound remarkably like laughter. One of the first things that infants do early in life is laugh. Even babies born deaf spontaneously produce laughter. Humans are not the only animals that tickle either. Macaques and chimpanzees both engage in the activity too.
> 
> All this suggests that laughter from tickling evolved over 10m years ago with the common ancestor that humans shared with these other primates. Dr Kamiloglu suspects that this early sort of laughter probably evolved to help primates build friendly relations, especially during play. With this in mind, she is now keen to study how infectious different sorts of laughs are. If the tickling laugh is one that truly evolved to bring primates together, it ought to be particularly infectious—but nobody has yet tested if it is.
> 
> As for all the other forms of laughter that only people produce, these probably evolved millions of years after tickling came along, when the human brain became complex enough to understand irony, slapstick and puns. But he who laughs last, it would seem, laughs longest.

#### Neurodiversity
Somebody wrote in a nice response to the Economist article on ADHD in the Nov 2 2024 issue: [Letters to the editor | Nov 23rd 2024 Edition](https://www.economist.com/letters/2024/11/21/letters-to-the-editor). 

> **Researching ADHD**
> 
> I read your article on research that questions whether attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder should in fact be seen as a disorder (“[Coming into focus](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2024/10/30/researchers-are-questioning-if-adhd-should-be-seen-as-a-disorder)”, November 2nd). The use of the term “neurodiversity” is misleading. An individual does not “have” a neurodiversity, any more than he or she can “have” any other kind of human diversity. Diversity in, say, the ability to control one’s attention or susceptibility to distraction is a description of a statistical fact, not a condition that one catches, inherits or develops. It arises from innate differences in the biology of individuals as well as the accuracy of measurements used to describe those differences.
> 
> We might add a third kind of diversity based purely on differences in social constructions about individuals made at different times or in different places by different families, communities, cultural groups, professional organisations and so forth. Divergent conclusions are often reached depending on who is observing one’s manifestations of self-control and attention.
