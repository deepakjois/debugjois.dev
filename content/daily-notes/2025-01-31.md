#### Tofu
[Tofu: never judge a food by its political reputation](https://www.economist.com/culture/2025/01/27/tofu-never-judge-a-food-by-its-political-reputation) #food #protein

> SUELLA BRAVERMAN, Britain’s former home secretary, blamed “_Guardian_-reading, tofu-eating wokerati” for a protest that closed a bridge. Ted Cruz, a conservative American senator, complained that Democrats want Texas “to be just like California, right down to tofu”. Across the West, eating tofu is seen as leftist, weak and somehow unmanly. This view is silly, and carnivores who hold it are depriving themselves of a [healthy](https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2022/12/20/how-food-affects-the-mind-as-well-as-the-body), delicious and adaptable source of protein.
#### Michelin Star
[The Michelin Guide is no longer the only tastemaker in town](https://www.economist.com/culture/2025/01/30/the-michelin-guide-is-no-longer-the-only-tastemaker-in-town)

> It began, implausibly, with a guide to French roads. In 1900 two brothers, André and Édouard Michelin, wanted to promote travel by car as a route to rev up sales of their tyres. Their first book gathered practical information such as maps and the locations of mechanics; later, recognising that travellers want fuel for themselves as well as their vehicles, it expanded its restaurant recommendations. The company first introduced its star-ranking system in 1926.
> 
> In the century since, over 30m copies of the Michelin Guide have been sold—making it about as widely read as “Gone with the Wind”, “[The Great Gatsby](https://www.economist.com/prospero/2011/09/30/the-book-of-illusion)” or “[Pride and Prejudice](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2020/06/27/the-bbcs-pride-and-prejudice-is-a-lockdown-delight)”.

#### Jevon's Paradox
This term has been blowing up in the feeds.

> Even as economic growth was just taking off, some economists were already pessimistic. Coal, wrote William Stanley Jevons in 1865, is “the mainspring of modern material civilisation”. Yet it was finite and would soon run out. Although more could be found by digging deeper, it would be increasingly expensive to extract and these higher costs would reduce the competitiveness of Britain’s manufacturers. After all, in other countries the black fuel was still in sight of daylight. Efficiency gains—using less coal to produce the same amount of stuff—would not save the country. Indeed, cleverer use of limited resources would simply provide an incentive to burn even more coal, which would, paradoxically, lead to an even faster use of British reserves. There was no escape, the Victorian economist believed. Coal would be exhausted and the country was likely to “contract to her former littleness”.

Some banger quotes from the latest The Review of Beauty issue

On skincare treatments

> “To want these kinds of results with bare skin is very shocking, because it doesn't make sense,” says Paris-based skin pharmacologist Dr. Elsa Jungman, Ph.D. Healthy skin should not look like food. “For me” — a scientist of the skin microbiome — “it’s hard to understand,” she says.

> The typical, multi-step, glazed-and-glowy skincare routine may sensitize the barrier and compromise the microbiome and acid mantle — the body’s built-in protective measures. The amount of moisture required for that wet-out-of-the-oven look makes the skin overly permeable, says aesthetician and product formulator [Mary Schook](https://www.msapothecary.com/), and prone to surface-level symptoms (redness, roughness, oiliness, flakiness, acne) as well as sun damage.
>
> At the very least, constant stimulation of the skin barrier can cause inflammation. It’s thanks to that swelling that pores may “appear somewhat tighter” and smooth as a steamed dumpling, according to Dr. Sadick.

On feminism and beauty

> Dehumanization is _always_ on the menu when it comes to female beauty standards. Throughout history, women were peaches, pieces of meat, their skin compared to porcelain — a plate on which their beauty (cheeks like apples, lips like cherries) was served.

> Activists quoted the late Audre Lorde: “Caring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation and that is an act of political warfare,” she said. Beauty brands slyly swapped the word “self” for “skin.” Customers ate it up — of _course_ Lorde meant Saran Wrap when she preached about preservation! — because exfoliating is easier than engaging in political action.

>  It’s in line with decades of unrealistic beauty ideals, which exist to service “a secular society” that worships “ever-increasing industrial productivity,” Susan Sontag writes in _On Women._ The philosopher describes a sort of self-objectification that isn’t concerned with appealing to men, but rather, with deifying and even identifying with products.

On capitalism and beauty

> If the male gaze describes the psychological condition of existing under patriarchy, the psychological condition of existing under capitalism could be called the “sale gaze.”
>
> The existence of an internalized sale gaze explains the current beauty culture climate: the rise of [the shelfie](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304279904579517920636130910) (an Instagram-worthy photo of one’s beauty products that, like the selfie before it, has come to communicate the poster’s “[perceived identity](https://www.actascientific.com/ASMS/pdf/ASMS-03-0324.pdf)”); the aforementioned conflation of “self-care” and purchasable skincare; and the era of ingestible beauty icons, marked by — and impossible without — significant and sustained product intervention. _Beauty_ has become synonymous with _buying._ After all, when you see glazed donut skin, it’s not skin you’re seeing; it’s the layer of sheer, shiny, mass-produced skincare formulas on top of it.
