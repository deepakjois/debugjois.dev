#### Daily notes indexing and search
[Add search and index features · deepakjois/debugjois.dev@6f3c661 · GitHub](https://github.com/deepakjois/debugjois.dev/commit/6f3c6613f594fe78d600d3aeeafbd76d96f91e1a) #website 

I used the excellent [bleve](https://github.com/blevesearch) library in Go to build indexing and search capability into the site. The search currently works on the CLI, but the eventual plan is to expose it at a web-based endpoint. I am also searching for a suitable low-cost provider where i can conveniently deploy this.

I just started diving into some frontend development for both podscript and my personal website's search feature. I used Claude a lot to understand what the different tools were doing for me (e.g. Vite and ESLint). 

I created a handy VSCode config that allows me to autoformat Typescript code on save, and also show ESLint errors in the UI
