> **Key points – How to make your life feel more meaningful**
> 
> 1. **A meaningful life is deeply connected.** Strong links to friends and family, to a community, to your work or to a transcendent realm can help you feel that your life makes sense and that what you do matters.
> 2. **Give yourself a meaning-in-life audit.** Rate how well connected you feel to sources of meaning in each of the key domains (close relationships, community, work, spirituality) and see where you have room to grow.
> 3. **Use the audit to refocus on your connections.** Strengthening your connections in any one domain can help you build meaning overall – so focus on where your ratings are lower, such as by joining a group that aligns with your values (the community domain), or seeking new, purpose-driven challenges at your job or outside of it (the work domain).
> 4. **Try existential exercises when you need a boost.** Practice self-grounding by writing about an important personal value and what it means to you. Or reflect back nostalgically on personal milestones, important relationships, or challenges overcome to remind yourself of how the past has shaped you.
> 5. **Pursue self-transcendent experiences.** Explore new spiritual practices, novel encounters with nature, or other pathways to enhance your sense that you are connected to something greater than yourself.
