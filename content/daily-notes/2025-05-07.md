#### Alternate Coffee Varieties

> While one solution is to shift production geographically as the climate changes, people like Davis, head of coffee research at Kew, and longtime collaborator Jeremy Haggar of the University of Greenwich, think a more sustainable answer is to diversify into climate-resilient choices among the 131 coffee species identified so far. 
> 
> The two most exciting new species on the block, Davis told me, are excelsa and stenophylla. Excelsa has a deeper root system, allowing access to water in drought conditions, and is also resistant to heat, pests and disease. The first coffee from a Ugandan excelsa project that he has been involved in will come to the UK market this year (he reports the smooth taste to be comparable to a speciality arabica).
> 
> Stenophylla is at a more experimental stage. In 2018, Davis and Haggar managed to track down the plant in Sierra Leone with the help of Daniel Sarmu, a coffee specialist in the country. Together with the coffee company Sucafina, the NGO Welthungerhilfe and the co-operation of local communities, the trio have planted wild varieties in trial plots across Sierra Leone with a view to reviving it as a coffee crop (its prospects withered in the mid-20th century as local farmers turned to robusta). The first harvest is expected this year.

#### Podcast Bros and Brain Rot

> People who don’t trust “experts” now look to podcasters and other alt-media figures—many of whom (including Rogan and Brand) are comedians—to decide what to believe about everything from WWII to vaccines to Ukraine to tariffs. The result has been a proliferation of ignorance with disastrous consequences for our culture and public policy.
> 
> Uneducated podcast bros have not found a magic shortcut to knowledge. Even on Covid, they have _not_ outperformed actual experts. However, it’s true that many so-called experts are fake and/or corrupt. Blind obedience to credentialed authority (associated with the left) or trust in a “marketplace of ideas” that rewards brain-rotting infotainment (associated with the right) are both failed strategies.

#### Matt Levine on Memecoins

And then they move on. I don’t know why this is a fun game for anyone to play, but apparently it is. In this game, somebody is going to make money by buying the token at the beginning of the 15 minutes, and somebody else is going to lose money by buying it at the end of the 15 minutes. There is not a different thing that can happen; the memecoin is not going to build enduring value and steady cash flows. It is going to go up while people are briefly paying attention, and then it is going to go down when they stop. Perhaps you can get people to pay attention more than once, but that is just repeating the same process; it’s not building enduring value.

> Oh now obviously if people buy the coin before its public announcement, they will do even better than the people who buy it right after the public announcement. And one can guess that those people are insiders who are connected with the promoters of the memecoin. But of course those are the people who will make money! It’s their meme! You are paying money to buy a token representing “I paid attention to Melania Trump today.” Who should get that money, if not Melania Trump or whoever set up the coin for her?
