This was a visually stunning movie, with occasional thought-provoking dialogue from its wide cast of interesting character.

Some interesting dialogue (from the [transcript](https://scrapsfromtheloft.com/movies/train-dreams-2025-transcript/)):

> The world needs a hermit in the woods as much as a preacher in the pulpit.
