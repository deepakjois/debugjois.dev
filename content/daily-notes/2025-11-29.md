This was a visually stunning movie, with occasional thought-provoking dialogue from its wide cast of interesting character.

Some interesting dialogue (from the [transcript](https://scrapsfromtheloft.com/movies/train-dreams-2025-transcript/)):

> Ain’t there any place in this world a man can get some peace?
> 
> \[narrator\] _Those were the only words Grainier ever heard the man say._ _They remained with him always._

> The world needs a hermit in the woods as much as a preacher in the pulpit.

> This valley is special.
> Used to all be under a glacier, you know?
> Three thousand feet of ice.
> When it broke, it just flooded the whole region.
> Carved out all these valleys.
> That’s where all those lakes come from.
> Can you imagine if you were back here then?
> This big block of ice, thousands of feet tall, and just the cracks and the freezing-cold water.
> It must have felt like the world was coming to an end.
> \[Robert\] Hmm.
> That’s where all those myths come from, you know?
> All those flood stories.
> All those different religions all over the world.
> It’s just the same story, different slants.
> Hey, I didn’t mean to be disrespectful to anything you believe or anything like that.
> I just, you know…
> No, no, no.
> I just find it fascinating.
> Can’t help it when I’m in a place like this. It’s just…
> \[tender music playing\]
> The world’s an old place.
> Yeah.
> Probably nothing it hasn’t seen by now.

> Yeah. I lost my husband too, a little over a year ago.
> It took him a long time.
> And when it was over, it was like there was a… a hole in the world.
> I had more questions than answers, like no human had ever died before.
> \[scoffs\] When you go through something like that, nothing you do is crazy.
> You just go through what you go through.

> In the forest, every least thing’s important.
> It’s all threaded together, so you can’t tell where one thing ends and another begins if you really look at it.
> The little insects you can’t even see, they play a role as vital as the river.
> \[exhales sharply\]
> The dead tree is as important as the living one.
> There must be something for us to learn from that.
> What if you got nothing left to give?
> Hmm? What then?
> Mmm…
> The world needs a hermit in the woods as much as a preacher in the pulpit.
> \[Robert chuckles\]
> \[breathing shakily\]
> \[voice breaking\] Yeah. Yeah.
> Is that what I am?
> A hermit?
> Well, I mean, I believe we both are, in our own ways.
> Just waiting to see what we’ve been left here for.
