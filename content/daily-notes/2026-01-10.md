I swear I had not thought that an entire article could be written on this topic.

> The design world, for the most part, is on board. Furniture maker Matthew Burt recently launched the Loo Library, a beautifully compact shelving unit in walnut and stainless steel with semi-circle cutouts in the corners, designed to fit snugly into even the smallest cloakroom. “The idea was to create something with interest and gravitas, while ensuring books could be easily reachable from the loo,” says Burt.

> Because it’s not just an issue of title selection (we’ll come to that) — positioning is key in a loo library, too. Books can’t be too close to the pan or too low to the ground, but must be within grasp from a seated position. Unlike the bedside table, in the loo you are privy to both hazards and logistical impediments. The books must be light enough to be easily held, not too precious, but also not too dog eared or well thumbed.

> …In Japan, there is a term, mariko aoki, to describe the urge to defecate when entering a bookstore — a phenomenon born, perhaps, from some deeply held or Pavlovian association of reading and the loo.
