> Last week, I got a message from someone I’ve known for ten years. It was articulate, thoughtful…and definitely not written by him.
> 
> It’s one example of what has increasingly unsettled me about the way people interact - myself included - as we all participate in this vast, unprecedented, AI-enhanced communication experiment.



> That’s when it dawned on me: we don’t have a vocabulary for this.
> 
> We’re surrounded by AI-shaped communication—but we’re still talking about it like everything is normal.
> 
> So I started writing down the weirdness. And it turned into a glossary.
> 
> Here are ten terms offered to help name, diagnose, and spark reflection on the strange new ways we communicate in the age of AI:

The terms listed are: 
1. Chatjacking
2. Prasting
3. Prompt ponging
4. AI’m a Writer Now (aka Sudden Scribe Syndrome)
5. Promptosis
6. Subpromptual
7. GPTMI
8. Chatcident
