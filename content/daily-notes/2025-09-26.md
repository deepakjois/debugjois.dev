#### The Rise of Matcha
[BBC Audio \| The Food Programme \| The Rise of Matcha](https://www.bbc.com/audio/play/m002jhm6)

This is the most accessible and comprehensive reporting about the matcha craze that I have come across. Thoroughly enjoyed listening to it, and gained a lot of insights from it.

> As sales of matcha continue to boom, Leyla Kazim traces the story of the powdered green tea from centuries-old Japanese tradition to global health trend phenomenon. We look behind the social media videos and headlines to find out more about the reported matcha shortage, how the matcha supply chain is reacting, and ask what might happen next.
> 
> Also in the programme Leyla learns about some of the misconceptions we have about matcha, including the issues around the term 'ceremonial grade'; we have a report from Kyoto Obubu Tea Farms in Japan about how tea farmers are coping with the sudden boom; and Leyla digs into the health claims about matcha with dietician and scientist at King's College London, Dr Emily Leeming.
