#### The Lost Art of Deep Reading

> This is not just a private loss. It is a civic one. Without the capacity to dwell in difference, to engage with arguments we do not agree with, or to follow a thread longer than 280 characters, we become intellectually and morally brittle. We lose the very qualities that democratic life depends upon: empathy, nuance, deliberation.
> 
> Deep reading, particularly of literature, philosophy, and reflective prose, offers not just insight, but rehearsal. It trains us in the moral dispositions that public life requires: attention, imagination, restraint. To give ourselves to a complex text is to practice the patience we need for one another. It is a rehearsal in understanding before judging, listening before reacting. This is not merely a virtue. It is a survival skill for pluralistic, tolerant society.

#### Beauty is Pain

> By now we’re all too familiar with the old adage ‘beauty is pain’. Traced back to at least 1800s France (‘_il faut souffrir pour être belle_’, or ‘one must suffer to be beautiful’), the phrase has been used for generations to justify the physical suffering many women endure to maintain society’s beauty standards. “If suffering is beauty and beauty is love, she cannot be sure she will be loved if she does not suffer”, as [Naomi Wolf wrote in](https://www.dazeddigital.com/beauty/article/45639/1/30-years-on-from-the-beauty-myth-we-ask-naomi-wolf-whats-changed) [_The Beauty Myth_](https://www.dazeddigital.com/beauty/article/45639/1/30-years-on-from-the-beauty-myth-we-ask-naomi-wolf-whats-changed) back in 1990, unpicking the ways a modern patriarchal society leverages beauty standards as a way to oppress women – even while gender equality grew in the eyes of the law.
> 
> We’ve seen this truth play out throughout history, through extreme grooming acts such as wearing corsets and fontanges, hairline plucking and foot binding, disordered eating, and surgeries. But it’s also embedded into the very standards themselves. Today’s trends for thinness – whether via [Ozempic](https://www.dazeddigital.com/ozempic) or #SkinnyTok – come with the same message as 00s heroin-chic, or the Victorian obsession with the aesthetics of tuberculosis. A malnourished body, a controlled and surveilled body, an addicted or diseased body – i.e. a body in pain – is an intrinsically feminine body, and a beautiful one at that.

Also learned a new term - *mewing*.

> What if modern beauty standards aren’t so much a war between genders, but a symptom of a system that preys on human weaknesses? It was philosopher Michel Foucault’s 1975 essay “[Discipline and Punish](https://monoskop.org/images/4/43/Foucault_Michel_Discipline_and_Punish_The_Birth_of_the_Prison_1977_1995.pdf)” that famously illuminated the state of the human body under capitalism. “The new discipline invades the body and seeks to regulate its very forces and operation, the economy and efficiency of its movements… to increase the utility of the body, to augment its forces,” he wrote. Today, the same rings true. In a [recent interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiBJeLrIoes) on Joshua Citarella’s _Doomscroll_, Professor Quinn Slobodian explains how we live under [neoliberal power](https://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/943/1/daniel-monk-on-the-dreamworlds-of-neoliberalism) that upholds a capitalist economy by prioritising marketability at all costs. To survive in such a climate, it’s necessary that we, as members of this society, consider ourselves as marketable goods too. Ones that are as strong, healthy, beautiful, and optimised as possible.
> 
> Under capitalism, the idea that we need to suffer at work to both achieve success and enjoy our lives is one that is driven home constantly, and the same is true for aesthetics; the more committed we are and the more we suffer to achieve them, the more we deserve them. Think of how we might believe that the more a skin treatment stings and burns, the more effective it must be. Labour is a good thing, under this view, and required of all of us to take part in the economy.

#### AI Browsers

At this point after fully moving over to Arc, the biggest thing I want in a browser is the concept of Spaces.

Here are the AI browsers mentioned in the article:
• **Comet** (by Perplexity)
• **Arc** (by the Browser Company)
• **Neon** (by Opera)
• **OpenAI's browser** (in development)

#### Hypernormalization

“Hypernormalization” is a heady, $10 word, but it captures the weird, dire atmosphere of the US in 2025.

First articulated in 2005 by scholar Alexei Yurchak to describe the civilian experience in Soviet Russia, hypernormalization describes life in a society where two main things are happening.

The first is people seeing that governing systems and institutions are broken. And the second is that, for reasons including a lack of effective leadership and an inability to imagine how to disrupt the status quo, people carry on with their lives as normal despite systemic dysfunction – give or take a heavy load of fear, dread, denial and dissociation.

“What you are feeling is the disconnect between seeing that systems are failing, that things aren’t working … and yet the institutions and the people in power just are, like, ignoring it and pretending everything is going to go on the way that it has,” Harfoush says in her video.
