[The Who Cares Era \| dansinker.com](https://dansinker.com/posts/2025-05-23-who-cares/)

> In the Who Cares Era, the most radical thing you can do is care.
> 
> In a moment where machines churn out mediocrity, make something yourself. Make it imperfect. Make it rough. Just make it.
> 
> At a time where the government's uncaring boot is pressing down on all of our necks, the best way to fight back is to care. Care loudly. Tell others. Get going.
> 
> As the culture of the Who Cares Era grinds towards the lowest common denominator, support those that are making real things. Listen to something with your full attention. Watch something with your phone in the other room. Read an actual paper magazine or a book.
> 
> Be yourself.
> 
> Be imperfect.
> 
> Be human.
> 
> Care.
