[The Who Cares Era \| dansinker.com](https://dansinker.com/posts/2025-05-23-who-cares/)

> In the Who Cares Era, the most radical thing you can do is care.
> 
> In a moment where machines churn out mediocrity, make something yourself. Make it imperfect. Make it rough. Just make it.
> 
> At a time where the government's uncaring boot is pressing down on all of our necks, the best way to fight back is to care. Care loudly. Tell others. Get going.
> 
> As the culture of the Who Cares Era grinds towards the lowest common denominator, support those that are making real things. Listen to something with your full attention. Watch something with your phone in the other room. Read an actual paper magazine or a book.
> 
> Be yourself.
> 
> Be imperfect.
> 
> Be human.
> 
> Care.

> Despite its emotional impact, though, “Adolescence” is fiction widely misinterpreted as fact. The very aspects praised as realistic are, indeed, statistically improbable and misleading.
>
> Shortly after watching the show, I [spoke](https://www.robkhenderson.com/p/from-incels-to-sex-robots) with William Costello, a PhD student at the University of Texas who is among the few researchers seriously studying the incel subculture. His findings complicate the simplistic narrative many viewers seem to believe “Adolescence” affirms.

> The creators of “Adolescence” may have intentionally crafted an atypical narrative to highlight how rage and violence can appear unexpectedly. Ironically, some of the series’s admirers miss this nuance, mistaking a fictional tragedy for a representative one.
> 
> In doing so, they overlook uncomfortable truths about the causes of most violent crime, which are rooted less in online radicalization than in fractured families and offline peer dynamics.
> 
> “Adolescence” is a superb work of art. It should not be mistaken for reality.
