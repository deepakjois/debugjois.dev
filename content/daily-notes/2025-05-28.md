[The Who Cares Era \| dansinker.com](https://dansinker.com/posts/2025-05-23-who-cares/)

> In the Who Cares Era, the most radical thing you can do is care.
> 
> In a moment where machines churn out mediocrity, make something yourself. Make it imperfect. Make it rough. Just make it.
> 
> At a time where the government's uncaring boot is pressing down on all of our necks, the best way to fight back is to care. Care loudly. Tell others. Get going.
> 
> As the culture of the Who Cares Era grinds towards the lowest common denominator, support those that are making real things. Listen to something with your full attention. Watch something with your phone in the other room. Read an actual paper magazine or a book.
> 
> Be yourself.
> 
> Be imperfect.
> 
> Be human.
> 
> Care.

#### Personal Software
[RedwoodSDK is a React framework for Cloudflare](https://rwsdk.com/personal-software) #software #programming #hipster

> We believe software can be personal again.
> Not just technically, but philosophically.
> Owned. Forkable. Shareable. Local. Beautiful.
> Built for use, not for scale.
> Built with love, not venture funding.
> Built for yourself - and maybe a few others.
> If this resonates with you, come join us. We're not just building a framework.
> We're building a future where software is yours again.

#### Adolescence
[What “Adolescence” Gets Wrong About Incels, Crime, and Class](https://www.robkhenderson.com/p/what-adolescence-gets-wrong-about) #tv #incel

> Despite its emotional impact, though, “Adolescence” is fiction widely misinterpreted as fact. The very aspects praised as realistic are, indeed, statistically improbable and misleading.
>
> Shortly after watching the show, I [spoke](https://www.robkhenderson.com/p/from-incels-to-sex-robots) with William Costello, a PhD student at the University of Texas who is among the few researchers seriously studying the incel subculture. His findings complicate the simplistic narrative many viewers seem to believe “Adolescence” affirms.

> The creators of “Adolescence” may have intentionally crafted an atypical narrative to highlight how rage and violence can appear unexpectedly. Ironically, some of the series’s admirers miss this nuance, mistaking a fictional tragedy for a representative one.
> 
> In doing so, they overlook uncomfortable truths about the causes of most violent crime, which are rooted less in online radicalization than in fractured families and offline peer dynamics.
> 
> “Adolescence” is a superb work of art. It should not be mistaken for reality.

#### The Copilot Delusion
[The Copilot Delusion](https://deplet.ing/the-copilot-delusion/) #copilot #ai #software #programming

> The thing I hate the most about AI and it's ease of access; the slow, painful death of the hacker soul... Brought not by war or scarcity, but by convenience. By _buttons_. By bots.
> 
> The real horror isn’t that AI will take our jobs. It’s that it will entice people who never wanted the job to begin with. People who don't care for quality. It'll remove the already tiny barrier to entry that _at-least_ required people to try and comprehend control flow. Vampires with SaaS dreams and Web3 in their LinkedIn bio. Empty husks who see the terminal not as a frontier, but as a shovel for digging up VC money. They’ll drool over their GitHub Copilot like it’s the holy spirit of productivity, pumping out React CRUD like it’s oxygen. They'll fork VS Code yet again, just to sell the same dream to a similarly deluded kid.
> 
> There was once magic here. There was once _madness_.
> 
> Kids would stay up all night on IRC with bloodshot eyes, trying to render a cube in OpenGL without segfaulting their future. They _cared_. They would install Gentoo on a toaster just to see if it’d boot. They knew the smell of burnt voltage regulators and the _exact_ line of assembly where Doom hit 10 FPS on their calculator. These were *artists*. They wrote code like jazz musicians - full of rage, precision, and divine chaos.
> 
> Now? We’re building a world where that curiosity gets lobotomized at the door. Some poor bastard, born to be great, is going to get told to "review this AI-generated patchset" for eight hours a day, until all that wonder calcifies into apathy. The terminal will become a spreadsheet. The debugger a coffin.
> 
> Because _you don’t know what you don’t know_. That’s the cruel joke. We’ll fill this industry with people who _think_ they’re good, because their bot passed CI. They'll float through, confident, while the real ones - the hungry ones - get chewed up by a system that doesn’t value understanding anymore. Just output. Just tokens per second.
> 
> And what’s worse, we’ll normalize this mediocrity. Cement it in tooling. Turn it into a best practice. We'll enshrine this current bloated, sluggish, over-abstracted hellscape as the _pinnacle_ of software. The idea that building something lean and wild and precise, or even squeezing every last drop of performance out of a system, will sound like _folklore_.
> 
> If that happens? If the last real programmers are drowned in a sea of button-clicking career-chasers - then I pity the smart outsider kids to come after me.
> 
> Defer your thinking to the bot, and we all rot.



1. **Read books**: Books convey the nuanced complexity of the world.
2. **Don’t use screens much**: This frees time for books and allows the mind to roam.
3. **Do your own work, not the world’s**: Focus on personal intellectual freedom rather than maximizing income.
4. **Be multidisciplinary**: Break down barriers between disciplines to foster innovative thinking.
5. **Be an empiricist who values ideas**: Prioritize empirical observations and insights.
6. **Always assume you might be wrong**: Challenge your own assumptions to reach deeper insights.
7. **Keep learning from everyone**: Embrace lifelong learning and insights from all individuals, regardless of status.
