A great way to start the day, reading Ava's birthday post: [28 things I‚Äôve learned - by Ava - bookbear express](https://www.avabear.xyz/p/28-things-ive-learned) #self-improvement 

My top 5:
- _Write online! You will meet some of the most precious people in your life that way. It‚Äôs worth the fear and discomfort a hundred times over._
- _Love is not this huge complicated puzzle you have to solve. The situation itself can be extremely complicated, but love tends to be very simple. You don‚Äôt have to pretzel yourself constantly._
- _You are so wrong about psychedelics. Psychedelics are going to change every aspect of your life for the better._
- _You love to work hard. Sometimes that‚Äôs a useful quality, and sometimes it‚Äôs just a way to cope with your anxiety. You need to learn to pause and not try to fix everything all the time. Sometimes gritting your teeth and forcing yourself through it is the easy way out, and doing what you actually want to is the scary thing._
- _There are so many people in the world and so many of them are incredibly talented and beautiful and nice in ways that make you feel insecure about yourself. Try to draw confidence from who you are instead of worrying about what you aren‚Äôt. You are a subject, not an object._
- _You are a deeply obsessive person and love hits you like a train. Sometimes this feels purely alienating, but the extent to which you let your passions consume you is your best quality._

I lied and put 6 down because I could not choose ü§∑üèΩüòä

Love this book cover: [Book: Alice‚Äôs Adventures in a differentiable wonderland - Simone Scardapane](https://www.sscardapane.it/alice-book/) - The book PDF is free to download and looks really interesting. I find the idea of approaching neural networks as _compositions of differentiable primitives_ #neural-networks #ai #ml #books
