A great way to start the day, reading Ava's birthday post: [28 things I’ve learned - by Ava - bookbear express](https://www.avabear.xyz/p/28-things-ive-learned) #self-improvement 

My top 5:
- _Write online! You will meet some of the most precious people in your life that way. It’s worth the fear and discomfort a hundred times over._
- _Love is not this huge complicated puzzle you have to solve. The situation itself can be extremely complicated, but love tends to be very simple. You don’t have to pretzel yourself constantly._
- _You are so wrong about psychedelics. Psychedelics are going to change every aspect of your life for the better._
- _You love to work hard. Sometimes that’s a useful quality, and sometimes it’s just a way to cope with your anxiety. You need to learn to pause and not try to fix everything all the time. Sometimes gritting your teeth and forcing yourself through it is the easy way out, and doing what you actually want to is the scary thing._
- _There are so many people in the world and so many of them are incredibly talented and beautiful and nice in ways that make you feel insecure about yourself. Try to draw confidence from who you are instead of worrying about what you aren’t. You are a subject, not an object._
- _You are a deeply obsessive person and love hits you like a train. Sometimes this feels purely alienating, but the extent to which you let your passions consume you is your best quality._

I lied and put 6 down because I could not choose 🤷🏽😊

Love this book cover: [Book: Alice’s Adventures in a differentiable wonderland - Simone Scardapane](https://www.sscardapane.it/alice-book/) - The book PDF is free to download and looks really interesting. I find the idea of approaching neural networks as _compositions of differentiable primitives_, and building them as a type of _differentiable programming_ quite intriguing.  #neural-networks #ai #ml #books

A comprehensive intro to Typst, a new typesetting system written in Rust: [Exploring Typst, a new typesetting system similar to LaTeX - jreyesr's blog](https://blog.jreyesr.com/posts/typst/) - something I have been meaning to play with. I have been a longtime typesetting nerd, and one of the highlights of my life is getting Lua bindings for a font shaping library into LuaTeX, a popular typesetting system in the scientific community (details [here](https://tug.org/TUGboat/tb40-1/tb124hosny-harfbuzz.pdf)) #typesetting 

TIL - _niche construction_, courtesy of video: [We could make every human on Earth rich and happy—if we decided to | Agustín Fuentes - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWJvaAv74ls)

> But humans, for better and for worse, we reshape the world in a pace and pattern that nothing else does. So, when we talk about niche construction in humans, we're not just talking about making buildings or dams or using fire to heat things. We're also talking about ideas, faiths; beliefs about death and afterlife; about morals and ethics; about economics and justice. All of those things shape how we act. So, what we have to recognize then is the human capacity to create, to imagine, to live in incredibly complex societies, to build amazing technologies, is a double-edged sword, right? On one hand, it slices through all our challenges and makes us capable of doing a lot of stuff. On the other hand, it slices through bodies and lives and hopes and dreams. And so the same capacity that makes humans, in my opinion, amazing, makes us awful. We have the capacity to be the most amazing, compassionate, incredible organisms on this planet. At the same time, we have the capacity to be the worst, cruelest, most violent organisms- and it's that dynamic process that makes us human. What we can do is think technologically, biologically, ecologically, and ask questions about sustainability. And maybe to do this, we might want to listen to peoples around the planet, who are not the major contributors to the problems. It's just that we've been trying one system, a particular mode of economics and technology, and yeah, it's sort of gotten us into a bad place. So maybe, just maybe, we need to think culturally, a little bit more expansively, to do a better job of biologically and ecologically engaging with the world. Now, many people will just say, "Well, it's just nature." Right? The fact that some people are rich and some people are poor, it's just nature. The fact that in some cases men are violent to women, it's just nature. There's never just nature: It's always history and politics and culture and experience and biology and bodies and brains and hormones and diets- all mixed together. So, anyone that says things are the way they are because of human nature, doesn't know what human nature is.
