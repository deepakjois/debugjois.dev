I love the term. Some good recommendations for one bag travel.

#### Deutschland vs Berlin
From: [#430: Oct. 7 events, drones, döner saved, pudding with fork](https://www.20percent.berlin/p/430-oct-7-events-drones-doner-saved?publication_id=458928&post_id=175361430&triggerShare=true&isFreemail=true&r=17wsq&triedRedirect=true)

> Also true since at least the 1970s: **The rest of Germany hating on Berlin.** In [a new survey conducted by Tagesspiegel and the Free University](https://substack.com/redirect/8b58ec06-8a2c-4cda-ad5c-a5db4052b9b2?j=eyJ1IjoiMTd3c3EifQ.ECtl8lkDs713Vuridjfm_uxb9jvYL9Upd9MRq67_mLM), Berlin ranked lowest in terms of likeability of any of the 16 Bundesländer or federal states (along with Bremen and Hamburg, we’re a city and a state). Hamburg came on top. **What do Germans hate about Berlin?** “Too multicultural, too dirty, too criminal, too full,” according to some comments by the 1,600 people surveyed. Other (stereotypical) criticisms the yokels out there brought up about us Berliners: “Loudmouths, hipsters, especially woke, direct, loud, argumentative.” Can’t really argue there.
