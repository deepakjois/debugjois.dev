#### eSIM annoyance
[I switched to eSIM in 2025, and I am full of regret - Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/i-switched-to-esim-in-2025-and-i-am-full-of-regret/) #phones #mobile

> Most people won’t need to move their phone number very often, but the risk that your eSIM goes up in smoke when you do is very real. Compare that to a physical SIM card, which will virtually never fail unless you damage the card. Swapping that tiny bit of plastic takes a few seconds, and it never requires you to sit on hold with your carrier’s support agents or drive to a store. In short, a physical SIM is essentially foolproof, and eSIM is not.

> Obviously, the solution is not to remove multifactor authentication—your phone number is, unfortunately, too important to be unguarded. However, carriers’ use of SMS to control account access is self-defeating and virtually guarantees people are going to have bad experiences in the era of eSIM. Enshittification has truly come for SIM cards.

This hits home as somebody who has three numbers I have to maintain across the three different countries I have bases in.

This bit in the end summarizes my feelings about technology enshittification nicely

> We gave up the headphone jack. We gave up the microSD card. Is all this worthwhile to boost battery capacity by 8 percent? That’s a tough sell.

#### Book Recommendations on Learning Philosophies
[Pedagogy Recommendations](https://parentheticallyspeaking.org/articles/pedagogy-recommendations/)

The readings section here is interesting

Over the years I’ve accumulated a small list of books that I like to recommend:

- [The ABCs of How We Learn](https://wwnorton.com/books/The-ABCs-of-How-We-Learn/) by Daniel L. Schwartz, Jessica M. Tsang, Kristen P. Blair. The “ABC” is a gimmick and wears thin in predictable ways, but it also forces the authors to limit how many entries to have. Don’t let this get in the way of high-quality advice from experts.
    
- [How Learning Happens: Seminal Works in Educational Psychology and What They Mean in Practice](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9780429061523/learning-happens-paul-kirschner-carl-hendrick) by Paul A. Kirschner, Carl Hendrick. This book wears the research even more explicitly on its sleeve, but every paper is distilled into actionable content.
    
- [Understanding How we Learn: a Visual Guide](https://www.learningscientists.org/uhwl) by Yana Weinstein, Megan Sumeracki. A third way to organize similar ideas. Also combines cognitive science and education.
    

Each one has the following important charactersitics:

- Its content is research-based, not just opinion.
- It is written in an accessible style, suitable for non-experts.
- It provides actionable advice.
- It’s fairly small.

Simply implementing a handful of key ideas (that are new to you) from these books will make you a much more effective educator.

In addition, I’ve also found these very useful and thought-provoking, though they are not as immediately actionable:

- [How People Learn: Brain, Mind, Experience, and School](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/9853/how-people-learn-brain-mind-experience-and-school-expanded-edition) from The National Academies Press. This is a significant summary of the research on learning.
    
- [The Teaching Gap](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Teaching-Gap/James-W-Stigler/9781439143131) by James W. Stigler and James Hiebert. An important book about what goes wrong specifically in American schools.
    

Books others have recommended:

- [How Learning Works: Eight Research-Based Principles for Smart Teaching](https://www.wiley.com/en-br/How+Learning+Works%3A+Eight+Research-Based+Principles+for+Smart+Teaching%2C+2nd+Edition-p-9781119861690) came recommended by Adam Shostack. I have read the first edition, which had seven principles. I thought it was both full of good research and had a lot of actionable feedback. I found some chapters weaker, and was annoyed by its boosterism for analogy without recognizing its problems. But these are minor issues; if this book appeals to you, go ahead!
