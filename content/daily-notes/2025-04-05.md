#### Four Thousand Weeks by Oliver Burkeman - Cosmic Insignificance Therapy
This is my second time reading the book. Actually, it is the first because the first time I listened to it as an audio book. I am also reading this book right now as I slowly embark on a reset of long held belief and patterns of behavior around productivity and achievement. 

These excerpts from the chapter titled _Cosmic Insignifance Therapy_ really hit home.
