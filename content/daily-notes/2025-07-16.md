#### Google Finds a Crack in Amazon’s Cloud Dominance
[Google Finds a Crack in Amazon’s Cloud Dominance — The Information](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/google-finds-crack-amazons-cloud-dominance?rc=arnbfe) #gcp #google #aws #amazon #ai  #startups 

> AWS generates more than twice as much revenue as Google Cloud and has long dominated the market for selling cloud services to startups. But the Dia episode and other examples show how Google has become competitive in attracting AI startups to its cloud, thanks to Gemini and other capabilities AWS doesn’t have.
> 
> AWS’ struggle to develop a strong AI model of its own has fueled a perception that it is trailing Google in developing cutting-edge AI.
> 
> That’s a big turnaround after Google’s earlier struggles with previous versions of Gemini and startups’ widespread complaints about the difficulty of setting up Google Cloud accounts for AI computing.
> 
> Google Cloud has even landed business from two high-profile AI startups its own AI teams compete with: Safe Superintelligence Inc., led by former OpenAI Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever; and Thinking Machines Lab, helmed by former OpenAI Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati. (AWS may have wanted Murati’s business, too: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy [met with her in San Francisco](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/ex-openai-cto-muratis-startup-plans-compete-openai-others?rc=c48ukx) earlier this year.)
> 
> Google Cloud also recently won business from an even fiercer rival, OpenAI, which has been a major customer of Microsoft cloud servers but has been branching out to other providers.
