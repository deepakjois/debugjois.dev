#### all the information I consume on the internet
I feel like one of my big failings, and simultaneously my big flex is the amount of information I track on the internet. On the one hand - after years of doing this I seem have developed a remarkable ability to hold a conversation or spout random bits of knowledge on a wide variety of topics, which seems like a useful skill to have. On the other, I think the time and effort that I dedicate to this has prevented me from engaging in some forms of deep work that I would very much like to do. 

In any case, there is no question that I push myself to the point of information overload, and actually enjoy myself while doing it. Here is my rough system around how I manage to do it.

- The easy part is subscribing to mainstream media stuff - i have subscriptions to Economist, Financial Times (the international one), Bloomberg News, NYTimes and The Hindu. I have subscribed to the Economist since a decade, and  I highly recommend it.
