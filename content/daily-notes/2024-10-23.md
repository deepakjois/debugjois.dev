#### all the information I consume on the internet
I feel like one of my big failings, and simultaneously my big flex is the amount of information I track on the internet. On the one hand - after years of doing this I seem have developed a remarkable ability to hold a conversation or spout random bits of knowledge on a wide variety of topics, which seems like a useful skill to have. On the other, I think the time and effort that I dedicate to this has prevented me from engaging in some forms of deep work that I would very much like to do. 

In any case, there is no question that I push myself to the point of information overload, and actually enjoy myself while doing it. Here is my rough system around how I manage to do it.

- **Mainstream Media:** The easy part is subscribing to mainstream media stuff - i have subscriptions to Economist, Financial Times (the international one), Bloomberg News, NYTimes and The Hindu. I have subscribed to the Economist since a decade, and  I highly recommend it.
- **Podcasts:** I listen to podcasts on Podcast Addict at 2x speed most times. Over the years I have gotten used to listening to stuff at that speed without too much loss of context. Here is the OPML file export from Podcast Addict app that contains a list of all 180+ podcasts I am subscribed to: [OPML file listing all the Podcast feeds I subscribe to Â· GitHub](https://gist.github.com/deepakjois/6542597f19e67a6737a4d279c8261fb2)
- **Other Internet Content:** most other reading I rely on RSS/Atom feeds. RSS and Atom are web feed formats that allow users to receive updates from websites in a structured way. It is often used by news sites and blogs to aggregate new content like news articles or blog posts. Most people don't know that a lot of sites and blogs on the internet syndicate their content via feeds (for e.g. [Substack does](https://support.substack.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038239391-Is-there-an-RSS-feed-for-my-publication), and so do blogs powered by popular software like Wordpress). To read these feeds you need a software called a Feed Reader. I use [Newsblur](https://newsblur.com/), which is reasonably priced hosted service. There are other hosted options like [Feedly](https://feedly.com/) which are more popular. One can also use a feed reader app on a Mac or PC.
- **Email Newsletters:** Both Feedly and Newsblur also support reading email newsletters using their feed reader interface. You can either use a custom email address they provide
