#### How should you choose your career
[How Should You Choose Your Career? - Scott H Young](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2025/06/11/choose-your-career/) #career #jobs 

> **“Cool” careers tend to be overrated.** All else being equal, the career paths that look fun, interesting or high-status tend to be more competitive. That might be fine if you’re passionate and highly-ambitious, but it does mean you’re picking a steeper hill to climb than a less-glamorous career in which you do useful work.

#### It matters, I care

> Let me be clear: **It fucking matters.** Truth matters. Documentation matters. Fighting corruption matters. That accountability seems out of reach right now doesn’t change that. When we internalize the belief that nothing can change, we stop demanding change. When we accept corruption as normal, we stop fighting it. When we dismiss documentation of wrongdoing as pointless, we give wrongdoers exactly what they want: permission to continue unchecked and with no record of their actions.

> I understand the despair in these kinds of responses. We’ve all watched impeachments fail, courts falter, institutions buckle, and politicians repeatedly trade away democracy for their next campaign check. But giving up on the very idea that truth and morality matter is not just cynicism, it’s surrender.

> Without a commitment to documenting truth, all that’s left is propaganda. And we’ve already seen this play out in what were once some of the most respected publications: Major news outlets have bowed to Trump rather than defend their reporting. They depict Trump’s outright lies as mere misstatements and spin his illegal actions as “controversies”. They engage in reflexive bothsidesism, desperately seeking to present “balance” even when one side is demonstrably false. They describe attacks on human rights as mere policy differences. They uncritically repeat government statements that plainly don’t reflect reality. In so doing, they’re not just betraying their fundamental purpose and abandoning their essential role in democracy. They’re helping ensure a world where truth becomes whatever power says it is, and undermining our collective power to build a better world.

> [Studs Terkel](https://www.amazon.com/Working-People-Talk-About-What/dp/1565843428) spent his career during a time of immense change (not too different from now) documenting in _Working_ what happens to the people who do the work that makes everything else possible. He wrote:

> This book, being about work, is, by its very nature, about violence - to the spirit as well as to the body. It is about ulcers as well as accidents, about shouting matches as well as fistfights, about nervous breakdowns as well as kicking the dog around. It is, above all (or beneath all), about daily humiliations. To survive the day is triumph enough for the walking wounded among the great many of us.

> When people have melons or cucumber or carrots or lettuce, they don’t know how they got on their table and the consequences to the people who picked it. If I had enough money, I would take busloads of people out to the fields and into the labor camps. Then they’d know how that fine salad got on their table.

> There's a violence in making people invisible, in treating their work as just an input rather than recognizing their humanity. There is violence in ignoring the humans behind the story, ignoring the child fraught with misery in the name of progress.

> Steve Bannon described the Trump strategy as "flooding the zone” where you overwhelm people with so much stimulation that they can't focus on any one thing long enough to understand it. The stories like Studs told get lost. It's the same principle that drives social media algorithms: flood your vision with everything at once so you keep scrolling instead of stopping to think.
