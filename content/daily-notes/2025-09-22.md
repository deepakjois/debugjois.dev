#### Goodyear Welt Construction
First encountered this when I was reading details about my Thursday boots.

> Renowned for its durability and ability to be resoled repeatedly, Goodyear-welt construction involves stitching a welt—a strip of leather—around the shoe's perimeter, creating a cavity. After filling the cavity with the shank and cork, the sole is attached, providing strength and water resistance. This construction method results in shoes that are not only long-lasting but also easily repairable, making them a timeless investment in quality craftsmanship.
