[India’s best-known artist gets his own museum—in Qatar](https://www.economist.com/culture/2025/12/08/indias-best-known-artist-gets-his-own-museum-in-qatar?giftId=YjM2OWNkODUtYzkyNC00M2NiLWIzN2UtNjdjYzk0YWFhNmRi&utm_campaign=gifted_article)

> Although he died 14 years ago, aged 95, M.F. Husain is India’s best-known modern artist. He recently became its most expensive, too: earlier this year one of his works sold at auction for $13.8m, a new record for an Indian painter. The opening of Lawh wa Qalam (The Canvas and the Pen) in Qatar adds one more item to Husain’s list of achievements, for it is the first museum outside India dedicated to a single [Indian artist](https://www.economist.com/culture/2025/09/25/the-market-for-indian-art-is-booming).

> Why is the museum in Doha and not, say, Pandharpur, the town of Husain’s birth? The artist, who was Muslim, fell foul of Hindu nationalists, who claimed to be offended by his frequent depiction of Hindu goddesses in the nude. By the mid-2000s the harassment had become intolerable: death threats, vandalism of his artwork, an attack on his home by Hindu militants and an estimated 900 legal cases registered against him. He left India in 2006 and never returned, living between Dubai, Doha and [London](https://www.economist.com/culture/2024/02/29/britains-arts-still-dazzle-the-world). “It is a sad day for India,” the editor of the _Hindu_, a newspaper, wrote at the time.
