#### who do you go to for advice
[who do you go to for advice? - by Ava - bookbear express](https://www.avabear.xyz/p/who-do-you-go-to-for-advice) #friendship #romance 

> Everyone agrees with this conceptually, but most people have relatively little interest in living it. _Making friends is impossible as an adult. It’s impossible, I don’t have time. I just don’t connect with anyone in the city I live in._ We’re taught that we should work hard to get into and sustain romantic relationships, but friendships are supposed to be automatic and effortless. If you have to try, aren’t you doing something wrong?
> 
> Of course, the reason why most people don’t have friends isn’t because they never made them, but because they lost them over time. Maintenance is always the battle in love and in work. Asking your friends for advice doesn’t just serve you—your vulnerability and trust serve the relationship, as long as you make space to pay it back in kind.
> 
> The rewards and challenges of romantic relationships are so much more prominent in our culture than those of friendship. We’re presented with a straightforward narrative: meet the right person, marry them, and you’ll have figured out a major part of life. It’s no wonder that people often neglect close friends or renounce them or a partner.


#### The Cult of Creativity

> Given how much we obsess over it, the concept of creativity can feel like something that has always existed, a thing philosophers and artists have pondered and debated throughout the ages. While it’s a reasonable assumption, it’s one that turns out to be very wrong. As Samuel Franklin explains in his recent book, [_The Cult of Creativity_](https://archive.ph/o/FN2Fb/https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/C/bo194772998.html), the first known written use of _creativity_ didn’t actually occur until 1875, “making it an infant as far as words go.” What’s more, he writes, before about 1950, “there were approximately zero articles, books, essays, treatises, odes, classes, encyclopedia entries, or anything of the sort dealing explicitly with the subject of ‘creativity.’”
> 
> This raises some obvious questions. How exactly did we go from never talking about creativity to always talking about it? What, if anything, distinguishes creativity from other, older words, like _ingenuity_, _cleverness_, _imagination_, and _artistry_? Maybe most important: How did everyone from kindergarten teachers to mayors, CEOs, designers, engineers, activists, and starving artists come to believe that creativity isn’t just good—personally, socially, economically—but _the answer_ to all life’s problems?
> 
> Thankfully, Franklin offers some potential answers in his book. A historian and design researcher at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, he argues that the concept of creativity as we now know it emerged during the post–World War II era in America as a kind of cultural salve—a way to ease the tensions and anxieties caused by increasing conformity, bureaucracy, and suburbanization.


> Absolutely. The two criteria go together. In techno-solutionist, hypercapitalist milieus like Silicon Valley, novelty isn’t any good if it’s not useful (or at least marketable), and utility isn’t any good (or marketable) unless it’s also novel. That’s why they’re often dismissive of boring-but-important things like craft, infrastructure, maintenance, and incremental improvement, and why they support art—which is traditionally defined by its resistance to utility—only insofar as it’s useful as inspiration for practical technologies.
> 
> At the same time, Silicon Valley loves to wrap itself in “creativity” because of all the artsy and individualist connotations. It has very self-consciously tried to distance itself from the image of the buttoned-down engineer working for a large R&D lab of a brick-and-mortar manufacturing corporation and instead raise up the idea of a rebellious counterculture type tinkering in a garage making weightless products and experiences. That, I think, has saved it from a lot of public scrutiny.

#### Why I Gave Up My Smartwatch
[Why I Gave Up My Smartwatch](https://www.joanwestenberg.com/why-i-gave-up-my-smartwatch/) 

> Michel Foucault once described the modern subject as a self-surveying creature. Bent over spreadsheets, calorie counters, and productivity graphs, we monitor ourselves with the vigilance once reserved for prison guards. The smartwatch is simply the most intimate upgrade of that tendency: a panopticon you clasp on willingly every morning.
> 
> At first, it’s exciting. You learn how long you sleep, how fast your heart beats, how many steps you walk. But knowledge invites expectation. And expectation breeds disappointment. A night of rest that _feels_ refreshing gets downgraded by your sleep score. A jog becomes unsatisfying if the zone chart looks too flat. Even sitting still can trigger a guilt-inducing vibration to "stand up and move."
> 
> Eventually, I stopped responding to my body. I was responding instead to a dashboard.
> 
> William James once said that the faculty of voluntarily bringing back a wandering attention, over and over again, is the root of judgment, character, and will. It’s also the thing the smartwatch systematically erodes. It pings. It buzzes. It gives you little taps, like a child tugging on a sleeve. And each tap is a fork in the road: attend to your body, or attend to your device? This conflict isn’t always conscious, which is what makes it so dangerous. You lose the thread without realizing it. You forget what the body felt like before it was measured.
