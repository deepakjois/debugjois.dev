#### Matt Levine on Eurodollars
I talked about the Odd Lots 3-part special series on the history of the eurodollar yesterday. Here is Matt Levine adding more color to it. The whole section from his latest newsletter is worth quoting in full. #finance #banking 

> My rough mental model is that “dollars” are, in essence, entries on the balance sheets of US chartered banks. If you want to transact in dollars, you need to open an account at a US bank, or at a foreign bank that has a correspondent account with a US bank. And so dollar issuance is regulated by the US Federal Reserve, and anyone who transacts anywhere in dollars is, ultimately, subject to US financial regulation. This comes up a lot when I think about sanctions, or Tether, or Tether as a tool for sanctions evasion. I wrote last year, [about Tether](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/u/click?_t=f574328d4d0c4c359b90d8e49b10e21d&_m=a59851325004416786fa0da223888f14&_e=iXfp1dzcYh8B-Auf2gOhl0EwcZSaTcIB5c8zik1cqeqQFaotSL-LYr9BjqRR6TglunbkYCiRlwFFsXSR9zlMC-V9bIfhhjCOCX3RiSM2z7VmdBW2y4p2Zl532DxG0ulD6AR7ya6fO8EkF7rbVEusYm_P7bY8kyN0WvBXb6UFM4PFmtayyUOW5H3AeLuZ2FarTVRPK0Vm24LSo91YoeG7w-geIHiQLTzdyPh1qYC4-EeQfF37GelTTIp6O9kPe6r2Yxqc68qNLr9AxmmCFidbWSgf5dgg4yoX58iKSsBc1w04U1AEfrIjwAqO1cMgngXH7HJNy-V390s4i2Fj9wFY6g%3D%3D):

> > Dealing in dollars means going through the regulated US financial system, and the regulated US financial system, these days, is rather hostile to certain sorts of commodities dealings. (The ones involving Russia or Venezuela.) If someone came to you with “dollars, but not through the US financial system,” you might find that appealing.
> 
> But this mental model is incomplete. Bloomberg’s Odd Lots podcast has a nice miniseries on the story of the Eurodollar, told by Lev Menand and Josh Younger, that clarified my mental model. Eurodollars _are_ “dollars, but not through the US financial system,” dollar-denominated liabilities of foreign banks that are _not_ necessarily backed by dollar-denominated assets. (Like [Tether](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/u/click?_t=f574328d4d0c4c359b90d8e49b10e21d&_m=a59851325004416786fa0da223888f14&_e=iXfp1dzcYh8B-Auf2gOhl9SaPseKhkDSaL2LG9ZqAIs6Yew2nXRhzDSnHS2YUFlHpCuEzqYwtnclb0ILgKls7BkhoW0yg5hYZmniiVM3AUAn6nuhYeaczhjI5hBcLjQuWWsujCISs7D8QNjZGHJyFpT55WT2GD_LAJke6qWJMwEU6EP1dt99lUIrtKID2jy4hmTRF1Zhw2c_5Ls0SpSaURIH3JywJH4KITog5nKk6tZKbwqEpIGfvMsbLIHizEbztD-5cqcc3Vyll0OZy8-0-qWkOqfn4hr5xuGq2RwcDx4QED8lCYxNi0fT4ujICN9m4dAGZSWW1nsaENEouTseOg%3D%3D) [used to be](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/u/click?_t=f574328d4d0c4c359b90d8e49b10e21d&_m=a59851325004416786fa0da223888f14&_e=iXfp1dzcYh8B-Auf2gOhl6pwpTRRtBuzpw1FZ4FgPgPWvn9ukvs6kwEPWJG-PYT9T-xpgmXuJrFNruinuZArN-iK1mNtiDczs_IQSGL9twi0OsTKM_Dy6vZouNkeQLTZjcZ-GOqxG8KGV7qSsYT4--Ti-EwIQ6B4bIQ7McNW_bYZOFWzhBZ8GEbkK_SU9In6tRL9ExCF1TlbRlBATtbSyvEmuFFeoUpgu6RDi-VgmGUHARFm49U3s_d3UFi3ClsKmdSx_nxeDa9Lt8tOfeFTziq_oVlXRZTAxGNtUa6Oj98k8xDiYMjIRy4BwIaG15zmBjUoCWyV8PDYvcmahcU8rw%3D%3D)!)

#### Distorting Darwinism
[Distorting Darwinism - by Ilari Mäkelä - On Humans](https://onhumans.substack.com/p/distorting-darwinism) #evo-psych #evolution 

Great article with citations talking about armchair Darwinism and its pitfalls.

> As a scientific theory, evolution by natural selection is a historic success. Its use in human affairs has a murkier history. In Darwin’s time, evolutionary theory was distorted by philosophers such as Herbert Spencer, famous for coining the phrase “survival of the fittest.” Spencer was not primarily interested in evolution as a biological theory grounded in natural history. Rather, he saw in Darwinism a novel method of promoting his political ideas with the authority of scientific language. Appropriately, his slogan “survival of the fittest” became a justification for views ranging from *laissez-faire* capitalism to eugenics and pseudoscientific racism. In Spencer’s Social Darwinism, such measures were allowed to hurt the weak, for “the whole effort of nature is to get rid of such, to clear the world of them, to make room for better.” From the comfort of his armchair, Spencer turned Darwinism from a science of the curious into a philosophy of the powerful.
> 
> Not all accepted Spencer’s ruthless worldview. Some found themselves in favor of social solidarity and sympathy for the weak. A major spokesperson for the alternative view was the Christian orator and three-times Presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan, best known for his vehement anti-Darwinism stance in the Scopes Monkey Trial of 1925. In his time, Bryan helped fuse creationism into the American mainstream. When faced with a false choice between evolution and humaneness, Bryan chose humaneness.

#### High Intelligence and Predisposition to Psychological Disorders
[High intelligence: A risk factor for psychological and physiological overexcitabilities - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289616303324) #iq 

Abstract:

> High intelligence is touted as being predictive of positive outcomes including educational success and income level. However, little is known about the difficulties experienced among this population. Specifically, those with a high intellectual capacity (hyper brain) possess overexcitabilities in various domains that may predispose them to certain [psychological disorders](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/psychological-disorder "Learn more about psychological disorders from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") as well as physiological conditions involving elevated sensory, and altered immune and inflammatory responses (hyper body). The present study surveyed members of American Mensa, Ltd. (_n_ = 3715) in order to explore psychoneuroimmunological (PNI) processes among those at or above the 98th percentile of intelligence. Participants were asked to self-report prevalence of both diagnosed and/or suspected mood and anxiety disorders, [attention deficit hyperactivity disorder](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/attention-deficit-disorder "Learn more about attention deficit hyperactivity disorder from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (ADHD), [autism spectrum disorder](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/autism-spectrum-disorder "Learn more about autism spectrum disorder from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (ASD), and physiological diseases that include environmental and [food allergies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/food-allergy "Learn more about food allergies from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), asthma, and autoimmune disease. High statistical significance and a remarkably high relative risk ratio of diagnoses for all examined conditions were confirmed among the Mensa group 2015 data when compared to the national average statistics. This implicates high IQ as being a potential risk factor for affective disorders, ADHD, ASD, and for increased incidence of disease related to [immune dysregulation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/immune-dysregulation "Learn more about immune dysregulation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). Preliminary findings strongly support a hyper brain/hyper body association which may have substantial individual and societal implications and warrants further investigation to best identify and serve this at-risk population.
