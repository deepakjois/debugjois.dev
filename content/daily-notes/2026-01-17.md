#### Cracked Engineers
[Forget Vibe Coders: ‘Cracked Engineers’ Are All the Rage in Tech — The Information](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/forget-vibe-coders-cracked-engineers-rage-tech?rc=arnbfe)

Not exactly the kind of article

> In November, a young robotics startup called Gradient began interviewing applicants for an engineering internship at the Palo Alto, Calif.–based company. But after talking to a half-dozen of them, the startup decided to ditch its plan to add interns.
> 
> Why exactly? “Not worth our time,” said J.X. Mo, 23, Gradient’s co-founder. While some of the applicants had seemed promising, “none of them would be cracked enough for us to hire them,” he said.
> 
> These days, plenty of people within tech are after the same thing Mo is: a “cracked engineer,” a buzzphrase that describes an idealized version of a software engineer capable of thriving in the AI era through scrappiness, workaholism and technical savvy.

After looking at this figure, I figure I would put myself more in the category of a 5X engineer with the "willingness to use AI tools" and "capable of thriving in the AI era through scrappiness, workaholism and technical savvy", EXCEPT I am not exactly a workaholic 🙃. Does that make me "semi-cracked" then!?

> Before it became a banner for a certain kind of programmer, the term “cracked” originated from videogames, as slang describing an especially adept gamer. Someone with a series of gnarly kills in Call of Duty? They’re totally cracked—that kind of thing.
> 
> Within tech, the people most eager to hire a cracked engineer are often startup founders at early-stage companies that haven’t yet accumulated significant venture capital. With limited funds, they need engineers who can operate as the company’s only coder—or perhaps one of a handful at most. And while some engineers specialize in writing code for machine learning or cloud infrastructure, cracked engineers are versatile enough to do it all.
> 
> Furthermore, these founders often view cracked engineers as more likely to be undiscovered savants who aren’t after cushy positions at big tech companies, rather than programming veterans. They are typically in their 20s, but they may have accumulated a decade of work experience by the time they reach their mid-20s, startup founders say. Most have little interest in managing other people.

My vote is No.
