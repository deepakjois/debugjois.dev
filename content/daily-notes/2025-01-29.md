#### Links In Progress on Family Policy and Pronatalism
Lots of good links: [Links in Progress: Should we give babies the vote?](https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/should-we-give-babies-the-vote) #family #pronatalism #babies #children 

> **2. More evidence that access to housing is a fertility bottleneck.** [A new paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5046571) has found that receiving money through a lottery can boost the probability of having a child by 32 percent among Brazilians aged 20-25, and by 10 percent for those aged 25-35. But Lyman Stone, on his new substack, [explains](https://substack.com/inbox/post/154338267?r=27r4jr&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&triedRedirect=true) that these housing lotteries are not lotteries as we traditionally understand them but instead usually a way of extending credit to people who cannot get mortgages. Not only are the participants demographically unusual, they are also stuck paying in for years before they ever receive one. There’s a good chance that participants merely delay their fertility until they win a house.

> **4. Falling birth rates mean advanced economies could see per capita economic growth slow by 0.4 percent per year from 2030 to 2050.** Consultancy giant McKinsey publishes new [analysis](https://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/our-research/dependency-and-depopulation-confronting-the-consequences-of-a-new-demographic-reality#/) on how the global birth rate challenge will pressure public finances and depress living standards all over the world.

> **6. Married Chinese women are being cold-called by local government officials asking about their plans to have children.** The FT [reports](https://www.ft.com/content/5fdf42e1-2975-4c99-9031-a9f73c2251be) on China’s escalating efforts to raise birth rates.

> **8. India is getting old before it gets rich.** [Many parts of India have birth rates on par with western countries](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce9088men9xo), and are rapidly aging and dealing with shrinking workforces. States including Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh are considering policies to incentivize citizens to have more children

> **10. Superstar economist Claudia Goldin** [argues](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w33311/w33311.pdf?utm_campaign=PANTHEON_STRIPPED&amp%3Butm_medium=PANTHEON_STRIPPED&amp%3Butm_source=PANTHEON_STRIPPED) that the rapid economic growth experienced by countries like South Korea and Japan has led to a clash between traditional expectations upon women and their new economic opportunities that means they then have fewer children. Goldin does not empirically test her theory.

> **12. Each cohort of young Europeans is delaying the major life events of early adulthood** – like getting their first job, leaving home, moving in with a partner, and having their first child – by more and more each generation. [Those with highly educated parents are most likely to postpone all these life events more](https://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol51/23/51-23.pdf).

> **13. Don’t turn birth rates into a culture war issue.** In an [article](https://www.discoursemagazine.com/p/natalism-nimbyism-and-jd-vance) published in the summer, [Addison Del Mastro](https://x.com/ad_mastro) argues that attempts to subsume the birth rate challenge into culture war discourse distract from policies that can actually help more people start families and will never convince anyone unsure about parenthood to take the plunge.
