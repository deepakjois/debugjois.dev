#### Using gdrive API in Go
To access a Google drive from the Go API SDK in unattended auth mode (i.e. without the OAuth dance), we need to do the following:
- Create a service account in Google Cloud Console
- Make sure the service account has some permissions. It's unclear what permissions are required. I gave it `Owner`.
- Create some keys and download the JSON file
- THIS IS IMPORTANT: Make sure to give the service account access to the Google Drive folder that you want to access. This can be done by fetching the email of the service account located in the JSON file. I was struggling with this before I found the reply in this Stack Overflow post: [Google Drive API, Oauth and service account - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/49101592)
