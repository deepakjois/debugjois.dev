This is such a cool project: [Bop Spotter](https://walzr.com/bop-spotter). Now all I need is an RSS feed or a playlist to capture all the songs. #music #playlist 

> I installed a box high up on a pole somewhere in the Mission of San Francisco. Inside is a crappy Android phone, set to Shazam constantly, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It's solar powered, and the mic is pointed down at the street below.

> Heard of Shot Spotter? Microphones are installed across cities across the United States by police to detect gunshots, purported to not be very accurate. This is that, but for music.

> This is culture surveillance. No one notices, no one consents. But it's not about catching criminals. It's about catching vibes. A constant feed of what’s popping off in real-time.

Started Math Academy. Took a while to get through the diagnostic test, but I guess it turned out okay. I have set myself an aggressive goal of finishing the Mathematics for Machine Learning module by December. #math

#### Using gdrive API in Go
To access a Google drive from the Go API SDK in unattended auth mode (i.e. without the OAuth dance), we need to do the following:
- Create a service account in Google Cloud Console
- Make sure the service account has some permissions. It's unclear what permissions are required. I gave it `Owner`.
- Create some keys and download the JSON file
- THIS IS IMPORTANT: Make sure to give the service account access to the Google Drive folder that you want to access. This can be done by fetching the email of the service account located in the JSON file. I was struggling with this before I found the reply in this Stack Overflow post: [Google Drive API, Oauth and service account - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/49101592)

Added gdrive syncing support: [Add sync-notes-drive subcommand · deepakjois/debugjois.dev@2ed1a1d · GitHub](https://github.com/deepakjois/debugjois.dev/commit/2ed1a1d43451ae736c42996e2b57d4edffe9e5b9). Now I can update notes on my phone and sync them to gdrive. 

Will soon add a github action that will use this subcommand to sync, update the website and commit the changes back to the repo. Planning to use this workflow for that: [GitHub - stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action: Automatically commit and push changed files back to GitHub with this GitHub Action for the 80% use case.](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action?tab=readme-ov-file)
