#### The Anti-Social Century

This is a long and quite nuanced article on loneliness. It touches upon the usual factors - television viewing, time spent on mobile phones, time spent indoors, AI etc. But the one factor that interested me specifically was what he calls the phenomena of "Secular Monks"

> In 2020, the philosopher and writer Andrew Taggart observed in [an essay published in the religious journal _First Things_](https://www.firstthings.com/article/2020/03/secular-monks) that a new flavor of masculinity seemed to be emerging: strong, obsessed with personal optimization, and proudly alone. Men and women alike have been delaying family formation; the median age at first marriage for men recently surpassed 30 for the first time in history. Taggart wrote that the men he knew seemed to be forgoing marriage and fatherhood with gusto. Instead of focusing their 30s and 40s on wedding bands and diapers, they were committed to working on their body, their bank account, and their meditation-sharpened minds. Taggart called these men “secular monks” for their combination of old-fashioned austerity and modern solipsism. “Practitioners submit themselves to ever more rigorous, monitored forms of ascetic self-control,” he wrote, “among them, cold showers, intermittent fasting, data-driven health optimization, and meditation boot camps.”

> Richard V. Reeves, the president of the [American Institute for Boys and Men](https://aibm.org/), told me that for men, as for women, something hard to define is lost when we pursue a life of isolationist comforts. He calls it “neededness”—the way we make ourselves essential to our families and community. “I think at some level, we all need to feel like we’re a jigsaw piece that’s going to fit into a jigsaw somewhere,” he said. This neededness can come in several forms: social, economic, or communitarian. Our children and partners can depend on us for care or income. Our colleagues can rely on us to finish a project, or to commiserate about an annoying boss. Our religious congregations and weekend poker parties can count on us to fill a pew or bring the dip.

and then he throws in this very counter-intuitive insight

> Home-based, phone-based culture has arguably solidified our closest and most distant connections, the inner ring of family and best friends (bound by blood and intimacy) and the outer ring of tribe (linked by shared affinities). But it’s wreaking havoc on the middle ring of “familiar but not intimate” relationships with the people who live around us, which Dunkelman calls the village. “These are your neighbors, the people in your town,” he said. We used to know them well; now we don’t.

#### Bluesky Starter Packs for MI/AI/RL
I really want to move to Bluesky to track real time tech information content, instead of X. I found this Reddit thread which has some relevant starter packs: [Blue Sky Researcher Starter Packs for ML/AI/RL](https://www.reddit.com/r/reinforcementlearning/comments/1gwqp7s/blue_sky_researcher_starter_packs_for_mlairl/)

Also found this tool (haven't tried it yet!) to convert Bluesky Starter Packs to Lists: [Convert BlueSky Starter Packs to Lists](https://markallen.io/bluesky-starter-pack-to-list)
