Spotted an interesting comment on HN.

> I've been noticing the pattern among the kind of people who like/dislike AI/agentic coding:
> 1) people who haven't programmed in a while for whatever reason (became executives, took a break from the industry, etc)
> 
> 2) people who started programming in the last 15 or so years, which also corresponds with the time when programming became a desirable career for money/lifestyle/prestige (chosen out of not knowing what they want, rather than knowing)
> 
> 3) people who never cared for programming itself, more into product-building
> 
> To make the distinction clear, here are example groups unlikely to like AI dev:
> 
> 4) people who programmed for ~25 years (to this day)
> 
> 5) people who genuinely enjoy the process of programming (regardless of when they started)
> 
> I'm not sure if I'm correct in this observation, and I'm not impugning anyone in the first groups.
