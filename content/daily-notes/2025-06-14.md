#### The West has stopped losing its religion

> “I’ve tried alcohol, I’ve tried parties, I’ve tried sex...none of these work,” says Eric Curry at Pace University, recounting what his peers say about trying to overcome depression, ennui and loneliness. “Young people are looking and searching deeply for the truth.” Mr Curry says his recent baptism was the best decision of his life.

> The long rise of secularism, which Ryan Burge of Eastern Illinois University calls “a dominant trend in demography of recent decades” has shaped many aspects of Western society. These range from more liberal attitudes towards gay marriage and abortion to prospects for economic growth. Its sudden stall—and possible reversal in some places—is unexpected.
> 
> The most plausible explanation for the changing trend is the covid-19 pandemic. Lockdowns, social isolation and economic shocks affected almost all countries and age cohorts at about the time that the data on religious belief hit an inflection point. This is especially the case for Gen Z, whose years of early adulthood were disrupted, leaving many young people lonely or depressed and looking for meaning.
> 
> “The pandemic really was a catalyst” for becoming religious, says Sarah, a 20-year-old student at Liberty University, who grew up outside the Church but converted after joining a Bible-study group on Zoom during the lockdowns. “Probably over 75% of my friends who are Christians became Christian since the pandemic.”


> Young men are becoming particularly keen on God, overturning a norm that spans cultures and time: that women are the more devout sex. In America Gen Z women are now more likely to have no religious affiliation than their male peers, according to a study by the American Enterprise Institute, a think-tank.


> Instead, wider cultural changes appear to be playing a role. For most of the past two decades, God was on the receiving end of bad publicity, while atheism found pop-culture swagger. Books such as “The God Delusion” by Richard Dawkins, an Oxford don who in 1996 compared religion to the smallpox virus, or “God is Not Great” by the late Christopher Hitchens, a journalist, became bestsellers. Now, however, it is sales of the Bible that are booming (up by 22% in America last year).
>
> The most important driver of secularisation in the West in recent decades has been people abandoning their religion, says Stephanie Kramer, also of Pew. Loss of faith has had a far bigger effect on the numbers than ageing, migration or fertility. So if the net outflow of the devout were to end, as now appears to be happening, then Christians would retain their majority in America for at least the next 50 years, Ms Kramer predicts, rather than falling below 45% as previously expected. Hardly anyone saw this coming, just as hardly anyone predicted the pandemic. God moves in mysterious ways—and so do people.

#### How much protein do we need
[How much protein do you really need?](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2025/06/06/how-much-protein-do-you-really-need) #protein 

> Fats and carbohydrates, eat your hearts out—protein is the macronutrient of the moment. Rich people love the stuff. They treat it like ambrosia. Are they onto something?
> 
> Having protein on your plate is important. It is made up of amino acids, of which the body needs 20 types in order to grow, produce hormones and stay healthy. Nine of these amino acids must come from food. The World Health Organisation recommends 0.83 grams of protein a day per kilogram of body weight (g/kg) for healthy adults to maintain muscle and tissue health.
> 
> Elderly folk may be better off eating more, since muscles wither with age and older bodies are less efficient at absorbing protein. A review published in _Nutrients_ in 2021 suggested that a ratio closer to 1.2g/kg, together with resistance training, could help limit muscle shrinkage in older people. Children and teenagers, who are still growing, may also want more than the minimum, depending on how active they are. A paper from 2020 suggested that pregnant and breastfeeding women need double the recommended amount to maintain muscle mass and feed their child.

#### Fixing My Broken Attention Span
[How to Fix a Low Attention Span](http://archive.today/iNHjQ) #distractions #attention 

> In a sea of content about how the attention crisis is making life worse, Daniel Immerwahr, a history professor at Northwestern University, is a rare dissenting voice. The people who claim that there is a crisis of attention — “attentionistas,” he calls them jokingly — often come from legacy media, a field made up of people uniquely prone to becoming distracted by social media, partly because their jobs require long, unsupervised stretches of concentration. “To blame something on an ‘attention crisis’ is to blame it on the public: ‘We’re producing the good stuff; you guys just don’t appreciate it.’ And that’s exactly what every person in a dying medium has said,” he tells me, comparing the phenomenon to the fear felt by Anglican priests in the 18th century who worried that the popular new medium of the day — the novel — was distracting women from prayerful obedience. That the culture is potentially moving away from longform writing and toward audio and visual content isn’t necessarily a sign of intellectual deterioration, he argues: Who’s to say these formats aren’t simply better at transmitting ideas?
> 
> “Everyone says that the internet is polarizing our politics and shredding our attention, but actually it can’t be both,” he says. Rather, we’re in an age of “obsessional politics,” where people are factious and often misinformed but not apathetic. They’re watching multi-hour livestreams and plunging down rabbit holes and “doing their own research” — all activities that require massive amounts of sustained attention. And in doing so, they’re finding community.

### Fetch YouTube Transcripts
Something broke with my [ytt](https://github.com/deepakjois/ytt?tab=readme-ov-file) tool, so I had to go around looking for a way to extract YouTube transcripts quickly from the CLI. With the magic of [youtube-transcript-api](https://github.com/jdepoix/youtube-transcript-api?tab=readme-ov-file#cli), [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and bash, I was able to cook up this one-liner.

This is a great example of how uv is a gamechanger for the Python ecosystem. Before this, I would have never considered using Pythong because of all the package and version management hell I would normally have to go through to make this seamless.
