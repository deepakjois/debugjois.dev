#### Hamlet is a GenZ story

> It’s a familiar story these days. You might even be living inside it. Or, if not, you know somebody who is.
> 
> A young man returns from college, but he doesn’t have a job. So he moves back home. But here his life is aimless, and he falls into a deep depression.
> 
> Even though he is back home, it doesn’t feel that way. He’s disconnected from friends, and his loneliness grows more intense. His relationship with his girlfriend falls apart. He knows he needs to get his act together—but how?
> 
> It’s not all his fault. His family is a mess, and he lives in a broken household. His mother is a head case. His absent father is too demanding.
> 
> And the whole social and political situation is fractured. Our sad young man feels like one more victim of the pervasive dysfunction.
> 
> It’s the classic Gen Z dilemma. Almost half of them move back home after college nowadays. The odds are stacked against them at every turn.
> 
> But the story I’ve just told isn’t about Gen Z. It’s Shakespeare’s _Hamlet_—and it was written more than 400 years ago.
