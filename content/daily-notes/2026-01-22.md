> A sore subject rather than a make-or-break in her relationships, Kaya has also had several heated conversations with someone she’s dating over his “constant” use of AI chatbots. In the future, she predicts she’ll start to distance herself from people who rely on them.

Thinking less of somebody just because they have ChatGPT is probably a bit much. But relying on it for articulating your thoughts is a bit messy.

I would reconsider my relationship with that person if that happens.
