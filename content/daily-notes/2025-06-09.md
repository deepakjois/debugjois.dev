#### Taxes of the Built Environment
[Taxes of the Built Environment - by Josh Zlatkus](https://thelivingfossils.substack.com/p/taxes-of-the-built-environment) #diaper #culture #technology #skill

An interesting aside in an otherwise unrelated piece about…erm…potty training.

> As a brief aside, I think part of the reason we are so impressed with the abilities of ancient peoples is that we are surrounded in the modern world by so much technology, which obviates doing anything all that impressive. Don’t get me wrong: if our ancestors could see me typing away on my computer, their jaws would hit the floor. They’d be much more impressed by the computer itself, of course, than my ability to poke its keys, but I also think they’d reserve some of their astonishment for how quickly I hit the keys (90 words a minute, baby).

> By and large, though, people with little technology are asked to fill the gap with skill. People with plenty of technology, not so much.

and another one about concrete being one reason to necessiate diapers 

> Recalling Heying and Weinstein’s notion from _[A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century](https://www.amazon.com/Hunter-Gatherers-Guide-21st-Century-Challenges/dp/1800750943/ref=asc_df_1800750943?mcid=710147ad7ce63e8c8842412997efec69&hvocijid=2151750484161382549-1800750943-&hvexpln=73&tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=721245378154&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=2151750484161382549&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9007270&hvtargid=pla-2281435177618&psc=1)_ that the benefits of new technologies are obvious but the hazards are not, I would argue that one of the overlooked hazards of concrete has been to render the modern environment inimical to quick and mindless elimination.[6](https://thelivingfossils.substack.com/p/taxes-of-the-built-environment#footnote-6-164475141) The benefits of concrete are much more apparent—providing a consistent, level surface for people and vehicles to move on. Before cities were doused with cement and asphalt, floods were less predictable, roads were less permanent, shoes tracked more muck inside, and so on. In fact, because city surfaces were once more forgiving toward pee and poop, people and their animals likely peed and pooped on them more often, which obviously wasn’t ideal.

> So, why do diapers exist? In a word, concrete. In three words, the built environment. Diapers aren’t an intrinsically easier way of doing things; they are an easier way _given the built environment_. The built environment includes concrete, clothes, vast indoor spaces, hygiene norms, and so on. Really, anything that humans have “made,” as opposed to what evolution, geology, and so forth have provided.
> 
> Granted, the need for diapers is the sort of small to medium effect that most people don’t notice or care about. Ditto for the necessity of wearing shoes, maintaining a lawn, and showering daily. However, I hope through my writing to uncover more taxes of the built environment—and make people as incensed about them as they are their income tax.[11](https://thelivingfossils.substack.com/p/taxes-of-the-built-environment#footnote-11-164475141)
> 
> In the end, what is the broad impact of the built environment? Over and over the organism goes to act, to impulsively behave, and has its wrist slapped. _You can’t walk there. You can’t touch that. You can’t sleep now._ You can’t just _do_ anything.

> The built environment is increasingly like a diaper, smothering our natural responses often before we even have a chance to acknowledge them.

> “Class,” Williams writes, “shapes everything from how you define a good cup of coffee to what you see as the purpose of life.”
  
> Indeed. The book is filled with wonderful details about the things elites simply don’t understand about working people, like the fact that hunting might well be about keeping the fridge full rather than toxic masculinity, or that patriotism is attached to the fact that the military is one of the few ways up the socio-economic ladder for working-class Americans. 
> 
> While liberal elites tend to congratulate themselves on their “enlightened” political views and hyper-individualism, working people often see them as selfish, entitled and overprotective of their children.
