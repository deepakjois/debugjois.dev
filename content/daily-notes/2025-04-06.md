#### How Gatsby foretold Trump’s America
[How Gatsby foretold Trump’s America](https://on.ft.com/44hbZ3Z) #trump #oligarchy

> Celebrating its centenary on April 10 2025, The Great Gatsby endures as the defining portrait of Jazz Age extravagance and glamour — a shimmering vision of energy, affluence and possibility. Away from the brightness, however, lies a world where dreams wither beneath corruption and malice.
> 
> Observing the deepening faultlines in American society in the early 1920s, F Scott Fitzgerald guessed right: he foresaw tragedy in the country’s impulse towards grandiosity and self-destruction in its reckless dishonesty. While Gatsby doesn’t predict the Trumpian politics of 2025 in any literal sense, it perfectly captures the society that would embrace such politics a century later. The novel’s prescience lies not in foretelling specific events but in diagnosing a culture where power enjoys impunity and cruelty rubs out its traces — a society run by careless people.

> Fitzgerald’s verdict on them at the end of Gatsby has become for many a definitive statement on unaccountable elites today: “They were careless people . . . they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.”

> Gatsby reaches beyond the moral failures of its characters to expose carelessness as a political force. This includes not only the oligarchy’s immunity from consequence, but also the way extraction was equated with success. The unheeding brutality of so-called world-builders has returned most recently in the dark fantasies of Trumpism, and in Silicon Valley’s fatuous motto, “move fast and break things”.

#### Women and Work

> I have tried to articulate my own response to these questions after reading three recent books that explore work in contrasting ways. _Patriarchy Inc_ by Cordelia Fine goes deep into biology and culture to debunk the common (and, in the second Trump era, ascendant) idea that men and women are genetically predisposed to desire different jobs. Charlie Colenutt has produced an oral history of UK workers in their own words, 50 years after Studs Terkel’s US version, _Working_. And Emily Callaci reanimates the 1970s Wages for Housework movement, a challenge to capitalist assumptions about which labour carries economic worth.
> 
> Fine’s book follows her bestselling [_Testosterone Rex_](https://archive.ph/o/pqg5W/https://www.ft.com/content/946956e6-f2df-11e6-95ee-f14e55513608) (2017), in which she examines theories that this hormone is what creates inequality between the sexes: in Fine’s analysis, it’s culture, not nature. _Patriarchy Inc_ takes these arguments into the workplace, to demolish the contention that our genetic and hormonal differences mean it’s natural that women and men do different jobs (this would neatly explain why there are so few women in corporate leadership, for example). Fine pithily calls this the “Different But Equal” argument. In her analysis — and it’s one I agree with — we have, rather, been acculturated from birth to expect one type of work or another. Fine calls this “mindshaping”. And it can be reversed.

> Once men decide they want to do a job in large numbers, she argues, it becomes high-status. Fine outlines the early history of software programming, when women were considered suited to its demands as “a kind of puzzle-solving — like crosswords”, and held senior roles. In 1957, programmer Elsie Shutt became pregnant and was forced to leave her job at Raytheon Computing in Massachusetts. She carried on freelancing, recruiting other mothers as her workload grew. Shutt’s resulting business, Computations Inc, was rooted in collaboration between “physically dispersed part-time workers, in the days before email and Zoom”. It was very successful.
> 
> There’s no definitive answer, Fine says, to explain why women fell away from programming, after peaking in the mid 1980s — 37 per cent of computer science graduates in the US in 1984 were women. Software programming was rebranded as “software engineering” and, as more men rushed in, it became a high-status job. Screening tests became “dubious and gender-based aptitude tests and personality profiles”. Fine’s wider point is that when a significant number of a dominant group take desirable jobs, “social closure” occurs. Men hoard the roles for other men; the same would happen whenever there is a dominant group, because of our inbuilt affinity for others like us: “homophily”. It’s often not conscious, it’s how humans work, left unchecked.

> Fine deals in the structures that underpin corporate life. For what happens “on the ground”, I turned to Charlie Colenutt’s _Is This Working?_. He interviewed 100 people across the UK, and 68 made it into the book, identified only by age and job description. Throughout this long (probably too long) book, the common thread is that it is fate or chance meetings that determine many working lives, rather than planned careers.

> Colenutt groups the interviews into sections: “Sales work”, “Bosswork”, “City work” and so on. An online sex worker is with a panel beater, a security guard and a warehouse worker, in “Bodywork”. She’s a student, supplementing an inadequate loan, and finds the work “freeing” — but her account is a glimpse into the invisible, underpaid [sectors that service](https://archive.ph/o/pqg5W/https://www.ft.com/content/c4445e24-acf2-4315-adb9-0f66ce361d77) those in well-paid corporate jobs.

> The biggest question about work, which Colenutt and Fine approach, focuses on what and who we value. Emily Callaci’s _Wages for Housework_ goes further: it explores a feminist campaign to pay housewives. Why do we tolerate the lack of economic worth assigned to caring? And is a different view possible?
> 
> The book is, in part, a chronological account of Wages for Housework in the wider landscape of women’s liberation in the early 1970s, and also contains chapter-long biographies of five key figures in the global movement. I previously knew nothing about this important strand of second-wave feminism and the women behind it, including the American activist and anti-racist organiser Selma James, and Mariarosa Dalla Costa, an Italian academic and political radical.

> “Wages for Housework,” she writes, “is perhaps best understood as a political perspective, which starts from the premise that capitalism extracts wealth not only from workers, but also from the unpaid work of creating and sustaining workers.” As well as their employee, an employer gets “the labor of the second person who is at home sustaining him”. When the movement emerged in the 1970s, that worker was presumed to be a him.

#### LLMs from an operator's perspective
[LLMs: an operator's view - by James Stanier](https://theengineeringmanager.substack.com/p/llms-an-operators-view) #llm #operator #manager

> In the midst of the current LLM explosion, we as operators find ourselves amongst:
> 
> - A blistering pace of improvement in the capabilities of LLMs. New models and products are being released at a rate that is hard to keep up with.
> - Immense noise and hype online making all sorts of claims, good and bad, about what the future holds.
> - An expectation from our companies to go full-on with "AI", which typically means LLMs, both in developer tooling and in customer-facing products. AI is the new data is the new cloud.
> - Echoes in the industry that we are all now overstaffed as a result of productivity gains: that everyone should do more with less, and that AI is the answer to that.

> What we'll cover related to LLMs is:
> - The (real) rising floor of developer productivity.
> - The changing size of organizations.
> - The increasing importance of code reviews.
> - The changing nature of interviews and identifying talent in short spaces of time.

> As an operator, up-skilling your team to use these tools is now _essential_. Securing the necessary budget to give everyone access to the Pro tiers of ChatGPT, Cursor, or whatever tools represent the best fit for your team is a table stakes activity. And yes, this does mean that your budget will increase, but the productivity gains from an existing team will more than make up for it. Trade the cost of hiring new people for the cost of acquiring tooling.
> 
> You should also take the _adoption_ of this tooling seriously. It is not just a case of giving everyone subscriptions and hoping for the best. You need to invest time and effort into training your team on how to use these tools effectively.
