#### The performative male
[When did everything (and everyone) become so ‘performative’? \| Dazed](https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/69296/1/everything-everyone-become-performative-male-2025-authentic-social-media)

This article is about "performativity" in general, but imo the best parts of it are a slick breakdown of the performative male.

> The word “performative” has been thrown around in 2025, mostly to describe the “performative male”. The archetype of a performative male is a tote-bag-carrying, matcha-drinking, _All About Love_-reading man who curates his behaviours to attract women, using more “feminine” interests to lure them into a false sense of security. Appearing to look “not like other guys” while simultaneously acting _exactly_ like other guys is an unfortunately common occurrence in heterosexual dating. Online, the idea of performative men took on a life of its own – there are [performative male final boss starter packs](https://www.reddit.com/r/starterpacks/comments/1m4mxr8/performative_male_starter_pack/), [videos of men “performatively” reading](https://www.tiktok.com/@goodtrouble_/video/7558705015385378078?lang=en) and [even performative male lookalike contests](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/14/style/performative-men.html).

> To understand how everything and everyone became “performative”, let us first track the emergence of the performative man. Dr Rauchberg says the performative male trend was a splintering of last year’s celebrity look-alike contests. Most of these look-alike contests centred around male celebrities, like [Timothee Chalamet](https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/64959/1/meeting-the-best-timothe-chalamet-lookalikes-at-the-viral-nyc-contest). As these contests grew in popularity and were replicated, they sparked a larger conversation around how masculinity is enacted. She calls performative men the “Gen Z hipsters”, sipping matcha lattes and reading dog-eared feminist paperbacks instead of falling into the violent confines of the manosphere. “When the only media representations you see either fault you (men are bad!) or push you into warped misogyny, the performative male is an ironic, playful response that pushes back at weaponised misogyny in media,” she says.
