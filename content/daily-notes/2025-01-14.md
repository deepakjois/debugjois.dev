#### Stablecoin Bank
In all the bluster and bullshit about crypto, stable coins are one thing that I can get behind. To quote somebody on a podcast, "stablecoins have found product market fit". This is a good, sane piece from somebody advocating for a stablecoin bank to bring stablecoin payments to the mainstream and breaking the monopoly and high interchange fees of the likes of Visa and Mastercard. #finance #banking #crypto

#### Apple is Killing Swift
I came across this article written in Oct 2024 only now, because the Changelog newsletter featured it in their Jan 2025 newsletter: [Apple is Killing Swift - by Jacob Bartlett](https://blog.jacobstechtavern.com/p/apple-is-killing-swift)

> Modern Swift is a slave to the top-down whims of the Apple MBA cabal: who prize secrecy and sneer at community input. Unshackled from Lattner’s influence, or even the relentless drive to craftsmanship imposed from Jobs, it’s all about shipping the latest proprietary profit driver.

It's a scathing takedown of what Apple is doing with Swift, and on the face of it, seems pretty legit. I also found insightful the section where he describes the different models of open source programming language governance.

This also made me curious about why the [Ladybird browser project](https://ladybird.org/) led by Andreas Kling chose to use Swift going forward, which he tweeted about in Aug 2024

#### Career Situationship
That's the phrase of the day, I guess 🙃: [Danger Signs That You’re Stuck in a Career Situationship | True You Journal](https://www.truity.com/blog/danger-signs-youre-stuck-career-situationship)

#### Bibliotherapy
Link: [Bibliotherapy: Can reading help treat your depression? | Dazed](https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/65849/1/bibliotherapy-can-reading-help-treat-your-depression-anxiety-mental-health #books #depression #mentalhealth 

Didn't realise bibliotherapy is _actually a thing_. Also reminds of the recent Japanese book I read _The Bookshop Woman_ which was about a woman who met people in cafes, got to know them and then recommended them books.

> Today, bibliotherapy involves meeting with a trained bibliotherapist (a book doctor, if you will) to discuss goals, life struggles, and how books can be helpful for progression. The session is uniquely followed by a “book prescription”, which outlines a reading list to help process and better understand the issues discussed. Each book prescription is tailored to help clients understand emotions, gain insight, and discover new perspectives. The overall goal is to provide comfort from the aspects of life that can sometimes be too heavy and blinding to process alone. It is a mechanism for making sense of challenging situations and finding reassurance for various situational triggers.

> [Ella Berthoud](https://www.ellaberthoud.com/) has been a bibliotherapist since 2007. She regularly hosts courses on the practice and offers one-on-one sessions. Speaking to Dazed, she describes bibliotherapy as the pratice of prescribing fiction to cure life ailments. “It’s the art of giving the right book at the right time to the right person,” she says, adding that she believes that issues like anxiety, depression, divorce, navigating childbirth and worrying about climate change can be alleviated through literature as putting words to a once indescribable feeling can help actualise the the validity of a reader’s own experience. While she occasionally prescribes non-fiction to her clients, Berthoud largely prescribes fiction due to her belief that this genre energises the subconscious and leads to a transformation from within.

> [Emely Rumble](https://www.instagram.com/literapy_nyc/?hl=en), a psychotherapist and decolonial literature-based therapist, likes the practice’s accessibility, affordability and adaptability. In her eyes, bibliotherapy is simple and doesn’t require complex tools or techniques. From the humble nooks of a public library, it can offer a beacon of hope or a lesson in empathy.

#### The Global Collapse of Coupling and Fertility
	Yet another Alice Evans article: [The Global Collapse of Coupling & Fertility](https://www.ggd.world/p/the-global-collapse-of-coupling-and) #loneliness #masculinity #marriage #gender #feminism 

There are interesting parallels between this and the loneliness article from yesterday. A lot of the material seems familiar to folks like me who have followed Alice Evans for a while. But one bit about South Asia bucking this trend of decline in coupling caught my eye.

> **Why are marriages high in South Asia?**
>
> South Asia has, I suggest two distinctive features:
> 
> 1. **Caste and kinship networks are secured through marriage**, which remain vital for status and social inclusion. Girls are typically socialised to marry, obey their in-laws and stay put. A litany of relatives ask, “When are you getting married?” [Singledom and divorce are both heavily stigmatised](https://www.ucpress.edu/books/being-single-in-india/paper).
> 2. **Gender gaps in smart phone ownership are especially large**. Lack of access to modern technology inhibits women’s [cultural leapfrogging](https://www.ggd.world/p/cultural-leapfrogging-swiping-past).
> 
> With status so heavily tied to marriage and caste, and little confidence in dissent, weddings remain a firm fixture.

Both of these don't seem like desirable phenomena to me, so not exactly thrilled about the prospects of marriage rates being high due to these reasons. I would rather we dismantled caste and improved the gender gap in phone ownership 🙃.

Also found this great article that was linked:
  
But in recent years most of the fall is coming not from the decisions made by couples, but from a marked fall in the number of couples. Had US rates of marriage and cohabitation remained constant over the past decade, America’s total fertility rate would be higher today than it was then. The central demographic story of modern times is not just declining rates of childbearing but rising rates of singledom: a much more fundamental shift in the nature of modern societies. Relationships are not just becoming less common, but increasingly fragile. In egalitarian Finland, it is now more common for couples who move in together to split up than to have a child, a sharp reversal of the historical norm.
