#### Stablecoin Bank
In all the bluster and bullshit about crypto, stable coins are one thing that I can get behind. To quote somebody on a podcast, "stablecoins have found product market fit". This is a good, sane piece from somebody advocating for a stablecoin bank to bring stablecoin payments to the mainstream and breaking the monopoly and high interchange fees of the likes of Visa and Mastercard.

#### Apple is Killing Swift
I came across this article written in Oct 2024 only now, because the Changelog newsletter featured it in their Jan 2025 newsletter: [Apple is Killing Swift - by Jacob Bartlett](https://blog.jacobstechtavern.com/p/apple-is-killing-swift)

> Modern Swift is a slave to the top-down whims of the Apple MBA cabal: who prize secrecy and sneer at community input. Unshackled from Lattner’s influence, or even the relentless drive to craftsmanship imposed from Jobs, it’s all about shipping the latest proprietary profit driver.

It's a scathing takedown of what Apple is doing with Swift, and on the face of it, seems pretty legit. I also found insightful the section where he describes the different models of open source programming language governance.

This also made me curious about why the [Ladybird browser project](https://ladybird.org/) led by Andreas Kling chose to use Swift going forward, which he tweeted about in Aug 2024
