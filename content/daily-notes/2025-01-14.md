#### Stablecoin Bank
In all the bluster and bullshit about crypto, stable coins are one thing that I can get behind. To quote somebody on a podcast, "stablecoins have found product market fit". This is a good, sane piece from somebody advocating for a stablecoin bank to bring stablecoin payments to the mainstream and breaking the monopoly and high interchange fees of the likes of Visa and Mastercard. #finance #banking #crypto

#### Apple is Killing Swift
I came across this article written in Oct 2024 only now, because the Changelog newsletter featured it in their Jan 2025 newsletter: [Apple is Killing Swift - by Jacob Bartlett](https://blog.jacobstechtavern.com/p/apple-is-killing-swift)

> Modern Swift is a slave to the top-down whims of the Apple MBA cabal: who prize secrecy and sneer at community input. Unshackled from Lattner’s influence, or even the relentless drive to craftsmanship imposed from Jobs, it’s all about shipping the latest proprietary profit driver.

It's a scathing takedown of what Apple is doing with Swift, and on the face of it, seems pretty legit. I also found insightful the section where he describes the different models of open source programming language governance.

This also made me curious about why the [Ladybird browser project](https://ladybird.org/) led by Andreas Kling chose to use Swift going forward, which he tweeted about in Aug 2024

#### Career Situationship
That's the phrase of the day, I guess 🙃: [Danger Signs That You’re Stuck in a Career Situationship | True You Journal](https://www.truity.com/blog/danger-signs-youre-stuck-career-situationship)

#### Bibliotherapy

Didn't realise bibliotherapy is _actually a thing_. Also reminds of the recent Japanese book I read _The Bookshop Woman_ which was about a woman who met people in cafes, got to know them and then recommended them books.

> Today, bibliotherapy involves meeting with a trained bibliotherapist (a book doctor, if you will) to discuss goals, life struggles, and how books can be helpful for progression. The session is uniquely followed by a “book prescription”, which outlines a reading list to help process and better understand the issues discussed. Each book prescription is tailored to help clients understand emotions, gain insight, and discover new perspectives. The overall goal is to provide comfort from the aspects of life that can sometimes be too heavy and blinding to process alone. It is a mechanism for making sense of challenging situations and finding reassurance for various situational triggers.

> [Ella Berthoud](https://www.ellaberthoud.com/) has been a bibliotherapist since 2007. She regularly hosts courses on the practice and offers one-on-one sessions. Speaking to Dazed, she describes bibliotherapy as the pratice of prescribing fiction to cure life ailments. “It’s the art of giving the right book at the right time to the right person,” she says, adding that she believes that issues like anxiety, depression, divorce, navigating childbirth and worrying about climate change can be alleviated through literature as putting words to a once indescribable feeling can help actualise the the validity of a reader’s own experience. While she occasionally prescribes non-fiction to her clients, Berthoud largely prescribes fiction due to her belief that this genre energises the subconscious and leads to a transformation from within.

> [Emely Rumble](https://www.instagram.com/literapy_nyc/?hl=en), a psychotherapist and decolonial literature-based therapist, likes the practice’s accessibility, affordability and adaptability. In her eyes, bibliotherapy is simple and doesn’t require complex tools or techniques. From the humble nooks of a public library, it can offer a beacon of hope or a lesson in empathy.
