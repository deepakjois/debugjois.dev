#### The future of work is still human powered
From the latest issue of the [Working It](https://ep.ft.com/permalink/emails/eyJlbWFpbCI6ImNiNTQwNzkyNjNlNTAyZmRiNjdjZTc1Njk0NjcyMTQ3ZjVjNjU0ODUwOCIsICJ0cmFuc2FjdGlvbklkIjoiODc5ODliMWQtMTllNi00ZTBlLWJlMjYtODFiYjhmMzhjMWFmIiwgImJhdGNoSWQiOiI5YjU2NTFhNi1lNjI4LTQ0MGUtOTVmOC0yYzI2OGY2ZmRlNjYifQ==) newsletter from FT

> Marcus Collins, however, takes a different view. “I think we have overemphasised the importance of technology in the future of work,” the Michigan Ross School of Business professor and marketing expert told me on the sidelines of a conference in London this week. “I liken it to [the media theorist] Marshall McLuhan’s argument that technology is merely the extension of human behaviour.” 📺 (It’s been a long time since I’ve heard anyone bring up McLuhan — I welcome his return!)
> 
> And Marcus went on: “If we are to explore and understand the future of work, we have first to explore and understand the future of humanity. I would argue that the future of work is actually cultural, not technological. The technology is merely an extension of how we operate, who we are.”
> 
> He is the author of For The Culture, a marketing-focused book about understanding culture and its impacts. When it comes to our workplaces, Marcus said, we now have to decide if we value people for our shared humanity 🫶🏾 — or as a means to an end, when “our cultural perspective is that people are cogs in a machine to get some economic output that we are looking for”. The mass lay-offs we are seeing now, for example, are a sign, he suggested, that “these people do not matter”.
> 
> During this time of transformation, “the technology can be used to aid our humanity, or it can be used to, unfortunately, underscore the worst parts of our humanity. The technology doesn’t have an opinion. It is what it is and it’s value neutral. It’s really about the meaning we imbue it with, and ultimately how it extends our perception of what reality is.”

#### Socrate on the barrenness of a busy life
[Socrates on the barrenness of a busy life - Postanly Weekly](https://postanly.substack.com/p/socrates-on-the-barrenness-of-a-busy)

> Busyness goes way back in time. Two millennia ago, the ancient philosopher [Socrates](https://www.biography.com/scholars-educators/socrates) warned us to question the purpose of our constant activity. He thought the potential hollowness it might conceal was too significant to ignore. “Beware the barrenness of a busy life,” he said. It still makes sense even now. He also said, “It is possible that a man could live twice as long if he didn’t spend the first half of his life acquiring habits that shortens the other half.” But to understand Socrates’ perspective, let’s look back to the bustling marketplace of ancient Athens.
> 
> It was a vibrant hub of commerce, politics, and philosophy. It thrived on social gatherings, debates, and public events. Socrates saw many citizens consumed by the pursuit of wealth, power, and pleasure, neglecting the true purpose of life — the pursuit of [wisdom](https://thomas-oppong.medium.com/socrates-wisdom-begins-in-wonder-ef03bb0516cf) and self-knowledge to live well. He thought they were cultivating a barren orchard in their relentless busyness.

> Now, fast forward to our 21st-century world. [Socrates’ wisdom](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/17/socrates-philosopher-man-for-our-times) resonates louder than ever. Task and responsibility fatigue are growing concerns. We juggle careers, families, social obligations, and personal pursuits, often feeling overwhelmed and exhausted. The “always on” mindset is draining us.
> 
> Work expands into every part of our lives, turning nights into extensions of the day. We check emails during dinner and work late into the night. Every day is full of activity, but are we truly living? Just as Socrates cautioned the Athenians against mistaking mere movement for meaningful action, we must pause and examine the “fruits” of our frantic pace.

Found a great Medium article linked to the post above: [If You Subtract Work From Your Life, Would You Still Know What to Do With Yourself? \| by Thomas Oppong \| Personal Growth \| Oct, 2025 \| Medium](https://medium.com/personal-growth/if-you-subtract-work-from-your-life-would-you-still-know-what-to-do-with-yourself-a42e0aef4ba8)

> Before you go, remember this. You don’t need to quit your job to find yourself. You just need to stop confusing “busy” with “alive.” Work can be part of your life, but it’s not your whole life. You’re allowed to do things that don’t involve deliverables or deadlines.
> 
> Existentialist Sartre was right.
> 
> “Existence precedes essence.”
> 
> You existed before the hustle. If you subtract work and find yourself restless, take that as a signal. It means your life’s muscle for wonder is being neglected. You just need to use it again. One day, the work will stop, by choice or by force. And when it does, I hope you’ve built a life you can face. Ask yourself now, while you still can. If you weren’t working, who would you be? And then, start becoming that person, before you run out of time pretending to be someone else.

#### Literary Angst
[‘It’s not just a book, it’s a window to my soul’: why we’re in love with literary angst \| Books \| The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/nov/02/its-not-just-a-book-its-a-window-to-my-soul-why-were-in-love-with-literary-angst) 

> The stories, ripe with what Harrison calls “existential dread” and – no spoilers – with little prospect of a happy ending, are not obvious bestseller material. So what has happened? One answer is that our reading reflects our times, and we live in turbulent times. Madonna in a Fur Coat is a tale of passion set against the economic turmoil of the 1920s: why would it not appeal to readers living through the economic turmoil of the 2020s?
> 
> These books were, says Harrison, “written in times of change or moments of flux. They’re about, how do you live your life when the world around you is changing, and the things you thought you knew are no longer true?” In White Nights, each of the near-lovers is dealing with the loss of someone they loved – or thought they did.
> 
> There are of course other authors with similar qualities, so what drew these particular books to such a wide readership? The answer lies in the medium as well as the message. Dostoevsky and Ali have both enjoyed a frenzy of attention on social media, and TikTok in particular.
> 
> According to TikTok users, White Nights is “the most relatable love story I’ve ever read”, a book that “will follow you for the rest of your life”. Madonna is “devastating”, it’s “not just a book … it’s a window to my soul”.

> The fact that these books are, in some senses, pretty bleak does not diminish their appeal. It may even enhance it. “I think of that James Baldwin quote,” Edwards adds: “‘You think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world, but then you read.’ That’s how it feels to find yourself in these pages. Ultimately, it makes us feel less alone.”
