#### Annotating Books
[Marginalia mania: how ‘annotating’ books went from big no-no to BookTok’s next trend \| Books \| The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jun/23/marginalia-mania-how-annotating-books-went-from-big-no-no-to-booktoks-next-trend) #books #annotate

Looks like annotating books is in. I recently started doing this because I realised that it increased retention.

> There are two kinds of readers: those who would choose death before dog-ears, keeping their beloved volumes as pristine as possible, and those whose books bear the marks of a life well read, corners folded in on favourite pages and with snarky or swoony commentary scrawled in the margins. The two rarely combine in one person, and they definitely don’t lend each other books. But a new generation of readers are finding a way to combine both approaches: reviving the art and romance of marginalia, by transforming their books and reading experiences into #aesthetic artifacts.

> It is what her fellow scholar Jessica Pressman calls [“bookishness”](https://cup.columbia.edu/book/bookishness/9780231195133/): a post-digital behaviour that has developed among passionate readers. But that is not to say it is purely performative: annotating a novel can allow us to retrace our first journey with a book, as well as revisit our state of mind at the time. I think of the last book that made me cry, [Meg Mason’s Sorrow and Bliss](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jun/05/sorrow-and-bliss-by-meg-mason-review-tender-huge-hearted-comedy) – what would my marginalia have looked like when I read it back in 2021, sobbing through the final pages at the reflections of my own struggles with mental illness? What would I see now in the notes I’d made then?

> Annotation has also become a way of connecting: some BookTokkers lavishly annotate a copy of their friend’s favourite book as a gift, stacking the margins with observations and jokes; Marcela is excitedly planning to do this for her best friend. A dear friend of mine inherited the habit from his late mother and he now treasures the precious “scribblings” in the margins of her history and poetry books. Some people specifically seek out books annotated by other readers in secondhand shops – a spark of connection with the past – or even by their authors;

> I’m like McAlister, who says that while she annotates her academic reading, well, like an academic, she’s usually too immersed in books to annotate for fun.A

#### Learnings from 2 years of using AI tools
[Learnings from two years of using AI tools for software engineering](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/two-years-of-using-ai) #ai #software #programming

> Working with Generative AI is fertile ground for several cognitive biases that can undermine judgment. I find this a fascinating part of GenAI: how manipulative this technology is.
> 
> Here are just a few examples of potential cognitive biases:
> 
> **[Automation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation_bias)** represents our tendency to favor suggestions from automated systems while ignoring contradictory information, even when that information is correct. Once you've experienced success with AI-generated code, it's natural to start over-trusting the system. The confident tone and polished output can make us less likely to question its recommendations, even when experience suggests a different approach.
> 
> **The [framing effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_effect_\(psychology\))** reinforces the impact of the positive, confident phrasing of LLM responses. For instance, if an AI suggests that a particular approach is "best practice," we are more likely to take that at face value and adopt it, without considering context-specific factors.
> 
> **The [anchoring effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_effect)** can kick in when AI presents a solution before we thought about it. After viewing AI's suggestions, we can find it harder to think creatively about alternative solutions. The AI's approach becomes our mental starting point, potentially limiting our exploration of better alternatives. On the flip side, AI can also help us mitigate anchoring bias, for example when assisting with modernising a pre-existing solution we're already anchored to.
> 
> And finally, there is also a version of **[sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Fallacy_effect)** at work when coding with AI. Investing less human labour into writing code, should make it easier to discard code that’s not working. However, I've caught myself becoming over-attached to large pieces of AI-generated code which I’d rather try to fix instead of revert. Perceived time savings create a psychological investment that can make one reluctant to abandon AI-generated solutions, even when they're sub-optimal.

#### AI Killed My Job
[AI Killed My Job: Tech workers - by Brian Merchant](https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/how-ai-is-killing-jobs-in-the-tech-f39) #ai #jobs #software #programming 

These are some harrowing accounts of engineers from some of the top technology companies in the world, giving their take on what AI is doing to software engineering jobs.

> I have been a software engineer at Google for several years. With the recent introduction of generative AI-based coding assistance tools, we are already seeing a decline in open source code quality [1](https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/how-ai-is-killing-jobs-in-the-tech-f39#footnote-1-166816747) (defined as "code churn" - how often a piece of code is written only to be deleted or fixed within a short time). I am also starting to see a downward trend of (a) new engineers' readiness in doing the work, (b) engineers' willingness to learn new things, and (c) engineers' effort to put in serious thoughts in their work.
> 
> Specifically, I have recently observed first hand some of my colleagues at the start of their career heavily relying on AI-based coding assistance tools. Their "code writing" consists of iteratively and alternatingly hitting the Tab key (to accept AI-generated code) and watching for warning underlines [2](https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/how-ai-is-killing-jobs-in-the-tech-f39#footnote-2-166816747) indicating there could be an error (which have been typically based on static analysis, but recently increasingly including AI-generated warnings). These young engineers - squandering their opportunities to learn how things actually work - would briefly glance at the AI-generated code and/or explanation messages and continue producing more code when "it looks okay."

> This job market is absolutely punishing. I had a .gov job for the .com crash, a publicly funded .edu job for the 2008 crash, and a safe place inside a Dropbox division making money hand over fist during the COVID crash (Dropbox Sign more than doubled document throughput over 2020). This is my first tech winter on the bench, and I'm getting zero traction. 37 job apps in the months I've been looking, 4 got me talking to a human (2 of which were referrals), all bounced me after either the recruiter or technical screens. Never made it to a virtual onsite.
> 
> This has to do with me being at the Staff Engineer level, and getting there through non-traditional means. The impact is when I go through the _traditional_ screens for a high level engineer I flame out, because that wasn't my job. The little feedback I've gotten from my hunt is a mix of 'over-qualified for this position' and 'failed the technical screen.' Attempting to branch out to other positions like Product Manager, or Technical Writer have failed due to lack of resume support and everyone hiring Senior titles.
