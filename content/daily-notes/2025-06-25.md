#### Annotating Books
[Marginalia mania: how ‘annotating’ books went from big no-no to BookTok’s next trend \| Books \| The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jun/23/marginalia-mania-how-annotating-books-went-from-big-no-no-to-booktoks-next-trend) #books #annotate

Looks like annotating books is in. I recently started doing this because I realised that it increased retention.

> There are two kinds of readers: those who would choose death before dog-ears, keeping their beloved volumes as pristine as possible, and those whose books bear the marks of a life well read, corners folded in on favourite pages and with snarky or swoony commentary scrawled in the margins. The two rarely combine in one person, and they definitely don’t lend each other books. But a new generation of readers are finding a way to combine both approaches: reviving the art and romance of marginalia, by transforming their books and reading experiences into #aesthetic artifacts.

But that is not to say it is purely performative: annotating a novel can allow us to retrace our first journey with a book, as well as revisit our state of mind at the time. I think of the last book that made me cry, [Meg Mason’s Sorrow and Bliss](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jun/05/sorrow-and-bliss-by-meg-mason-review-tender-huge-hearted-comedy) – what would my marginalia have looked like when I read it back in 2021, sobbing through the final pages at the reflections of my own struggles with mental illness? What would I see now in the notes I’d made then?

> Annotation has also become a way of connecting: some BookTokkers lavishly annotate a copy of their friend’s favourite book as a gift, stacking the margins with observations and jokes; Marcela is excitedly planning to do this for her best friend. A dear friend of mine inherited the habit from his late mother and he now treasures the precious “scribblings” in the margins of her history and poetry books. Some people specifically seek out books annotated by other readers in secondhand shops – a spark of connection with the past – or even by their authors;

> I’m like McAlister, who says that while she annotates her academic reading, well, like an academic, she’s usually too immersed in books to annotate for fun.
