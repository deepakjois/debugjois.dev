#### Annotating Books
[Marginalia mania: how ‘annotating’ books went from big no-no to BookTok’s next trend \| Books \| The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jun/23/marginalia-mania-how-annotating-books-went-from-big-no-no-to-booktoks-next-trend) #books #annotate

Looks like annotating books is in. I recently started doing this because I realised that it increased retention.

> There are two kinds of readers: those who would choose death before dog-ears, keeping their beloved volumes as pristine as possible, and those whose books bear the marks of a life well read, corners folded in on favourite pages and with snarky or swoony commentary scrawled in the margins. The two rarely combine in one person, and they definitely don’t lend each other books. But a new generation of readers are finding a way to combine both approaches: reviving the art and romance of marginalia, by transforming their books and reading experiences into aesthetic artifacts.
