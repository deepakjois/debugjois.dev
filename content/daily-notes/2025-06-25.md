#### Annotating Books
[Marginalia mania: how ‘annotating’ books went from big no-no to BookTok’s next trend \| Books \| The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jun/23/marginalia-mania-how-annotating-books-went-from-big-no-no-to-booktoks-next-trend) #books #annotate

Looks like annotating books is in. I recently started doing this because I realised that it increased retention.

> There are two kinds of readers: those who would choose death before dog-ears, keeping their beloved volumes as pristine as possible, and those whose books bear the marks of a life well read, corners folded in on favourite pages and with snarky or swoony commentary scrawled in the margins. The two rarely combine in one person, and they definitely don’t lend each other books. But a new generation of readers are finding a way to combine both approaches: reviving the art and romance of marginalia, by transforming their books and reading experiences into #aesthetic artifacts.

> It is what her fellow scholar Jessica Pressman calls [“bookishness”](https://cup.columbia.edu/book/bookishness/9780231195133/): a post-digital behaviour that has developed among passionate readers. But that is not to say it is purely performative: annotating a novel can allow us to retrace our first journey with a book, as well as revisit our state of mind at the time. I think of the last book that made me cry, [Meg Mason’s Sorrow and Bliss](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jun/05/sorrow-and-bliss-by-meg-mason-review-tender-huge-hearted-comedy) – what would my marginalia have looked like when I read it back in 2021, sobbing through the final pages at the reflections of my own struggles with mental illness? What would I see now in the notes I’d made then?

> Annotation has also become a way of connecting: some BookTokkers lavishly annotate a copy of their friend’s favourite book as a gift, stacking the margins with observations and jokes; Marcela is excitedly planning to do this for her best friend. A dear friend of mine inherited the habit from his late mother and he now treasures the precious “scribblings” in the margins of her history and poetry books. Some people specifically seek out books annotated by other readers in secondhand shops – a spark of connection with the past – or even by their authors;

> I’m like McAlister, who says that while she annotates her academic reading, well, like an academic, she’s usually too immersed in books to annotate for fun.A

#### Learnings from 2 years of using AI tools
[Learnings from two years of using AI tools for software engineering](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/two-years-of-using-ai) #ai #software #programming

> Working with Generative AI is fertile ground for several cognitive biases that can undermine judgment. I find this a fascinating part of GenAI: how manipulative this technology is.
> 
> Here are just a few examples of potential cognitive biases:
> 
> **[Automation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation_bias)** represents our tendency to favor suggestions from automated systems while ignoring contradictory information, even when that information is correct. Once you've experienced success with AI-generated code, it's natural to start over-trusting the system. The confident tone and polished output can make us less likely to question its recommendations, even when experience suggests a different approach.
> 
> **The [framing effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_effect_\(psychology\))** reinforces the impact of the positive, confident phrasing of LLM responses. For instance, if an AI suggests that a particular approach is "best practice," we are more likely to take that at face value and adopt it, without considering context-specific factors.
> 
> **The [anchoring effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_effect)** can kick in when AI presents a solution before we thought about it. After viewing AI's suggestions, we can find it harder to think creatively about alternative solutions. The AI's approach becomes our mental starting point, potentially limiting our exploration of better alternatives. On the flip side, AI can also help us mitigate anchoring bias, for example when assisting with modernising a pre-existing solution we're already anchored to.
> 
> And finally, there is also a version of **[sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Fallacy_effect)** at work when coding with AI. Investing less human labour into writing code, should make it easier to discard code that’s not working. However, I've caught myself becoming over-attached to large pieces of AI-generated code which I’d rather try to fix instead of revert. Perceived time savings create a psychological investment that can make one reluctant to abandon AI-generated solutions, even when they're sub-optimal.
