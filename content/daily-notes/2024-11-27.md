Spent the whole day doing Math Academy because I had to catch up for what I missed yest.

#### Somebody Somewhere
Bingewatched all released S3 episodes so far.  This is such an underrated and sweet show: [Somebody Somewhere (TV Series 2022â€“2024) - IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12759100/) #tv 

#### Kendrick Lamar Samplers
The NY Amplifier released this playlist, and I spent the day listening. Not a very knowledgable rap person, so the notes were helpful. Enjoyed it: [The Amplifier: Kendrick Lamar's Samples](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu_RmAJBNiILR9yqYUTn2qdMSsLM2lLOg&si=ckZMkmAVdyHIn0k1) #playlist
