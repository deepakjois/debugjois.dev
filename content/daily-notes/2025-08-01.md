#### High Agency and Owning the Outcome
[Impact, agency, and taste \| benkuhn.net](https://www.benkuhn.net/impact/)

> I think of finding high-leverage work as having two interrelated components:
> 
> - **Agency:** i.e. some combination of the initiative/proactiveness to try to make things happen, and [relentlessness and resourcefulness](https://paulgraham.com/relres.html) to make sure you’ll succeed.
> - **Taste:** you need a good intuition for what things will and won’t work well to try. Taste is important both “in the large” (picking important problems) and “in the small” (picking approaches to solving those problems that will work well); I usually see people first become great at the latter, then the former.

> A common trait of high-agency people is that they take accountability for _achieving a goal_, not just doing some work.
> 
> There’s a huge difference between the following two operating modes:
> 
> 1. My goal is to ship this project by the end of the month, so I’m going to get people started working on it ASAP.
> 2. My goal is to ship this project by the end of the month, so I’m going to list out everything that needs to get done by then, draw up a schedule working backwards from the ship date, make sure the critical path is short enough, make sure we have enough staffing to do anything, figure out what we’ll cut if the schedule slips, be honest about how much slop we need, track progress against the schedule and surface any slippage as soon as I see it, pull in people from elsewhere if I need them…

Found this on another blog which has some good commentary on the original essay

> Striving for “inevitability”, as Kuhn frames it, isn’t about achieving perfection or eliminating all risk. That’s clearly impossible in most nontrivial areas of human endeavor. Instead, I think the real value lies in cultivating the mindset itself.
> 
> Adopting this agentic mindset takes conscious effort, especially initially. It means spending more time up-front planning, anticipating, and communicating, which can sometimes feel less immediately productive than jumping into writing code, or whatever the immediate “work” may be. However, investing time in up-front strategic thinking consistently pays off later. Having a strategy results in less frantic firefighting, fewer deadline slips, and a generally calmer, more predictable process for delivering impact.
> 
> The benefits of cultivating personal agency are beyond “merely” delivering reliable outcomes to achieve some abstract team/company/personal OKR. There’s a certain confidence and personal satisfaction that comes from knowing you’ve done the work to truly understand the problem, anticipate hurdles, and steer yourself toward success, rather than hoping things work out or leaning on someone else to keep the project unblocked. Agency also generalizes well across different domains of life. Developing agency in a professional context usually results in a higher ability[1](https://benjamincongdon.me/feed.xml#fn:1) to exercise agency in other contexts (e.g. personal, social, relational). Professional contexts are a good environment for developing agency too: in healthy workplaces, there is a clear feedback loop and ample opportunity to exercise agency.

#### Newsletters and RSS
[Curate your own newspaper with RSS](https://www.citationneeded.news/curate-with-rss/) #rss 

RSS solved the distribution problem a long time ago. It is really sad that it's been sidelined now, and we have to depend on email to bypass the enshittification of distribution platforms. But at least these outlets are realising the issue with giving up control over their own distribution.

> These intermediary platforms between news organizations and readers are undergoing a type of predictable decay Cory Doctorow calls “enshittification”: rip off others’ work while expecting high-quality journalism to magically continue to appear, even as journalists are starved of audience and revenue.
> 
> The newsletter strategy aims to bypass these rapidly enshittifying intermediaries and instead establish more direct relationships with subscribers. “I don’t intend to ever rely on someone else’s distribution ever again,” wrote __Verge__ editor-in-chief Nilay Patel on Bluesky.[3](https://www.citationneeded.news/curate-with-rss/#reference-3) Although email has undergone some enshittification of its own,[b](https://www.citationneeded.news/curate-with-rss/#footnote-2) its fundamental nature as a [protocol rather than a platform](https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech) has provided one essential prophylactic to enshittification: the escape hatch. If your email provider suddenly inserted ads two sentences into every email, you could easily switch providers[c](https://www.citationneeded.news/curate-with-rss/#footnote-3) and still receive emails from everyone you previously emailed. As a result, email has become a go-to refuge for news outlets fleeing their abusive relationships with deeply enshittified platforms they grew reliant upon.
> 
> But the surge in newsletters has been overwhelming. Whether it’s writers like me who’ve never worked in a traditional newsroom, journalists who’ve left or been laid off from traditional jobs, or established newsrooms entering the newsletter business, there’s a newsletter around every corner. Instead of subscribing to a single newspaper for columns and articles by a dozen journalists, now you have a dozen separate newsletter subscriptions, with articles appearing haphazardly in your email inbox amid bills, business communications, marketing spam, order confirmations, and two-factor authentication codes.

#### Male Anxiety and the morning routine
[How male anxiety built the hyper-optimised morning routine | British GQ](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/ashton-hall-morning-routine)

This article has a hilarious beginning.

> It’s 3.30 a.m. Besides a few night-shift workers, [insomniacs](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/sleep-deprivation-causes) and ravers, the world is unconscious. Not [Mark Wahlberg](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/mark-wahlberg-patek-philippe-cubitus-watch-2024). His alarm has just gone off, jolting him into life for a [long morning](https://www.today.com/parents/celebrity/mark-wahlberg-morning-routine-waking-up-kids-rcna118378) of eating, praying, [working out](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/tags/fitness), and sitting in his cryo recovery chamber. Not far behind him is Apple CEO [Tim Cook](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/tim-cook-apple-interview-2023), whose eyelids flicker open at [3.45](https://themodems.com/lifestyle/the-most-successful-global-ceos-unexpected-morning-routines/), so he can tackle some of the hundreds of customer feedback emails in his inbox before starting the meat of his day. At 3.52 exactly, the fitness coach and influencer Ashton Hall – whose elaborate, [Patrick Bateman-esque](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjKNbfA64EE) [morning routine](https://x.com/tipsformenx/status/1902608673022595531) has recently gone obscenely viral – is up and at it, ready for several hours of fitness, dunking his face in iced Saratoga mineral water, and rubbing said face with [banana](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/banana-artwork-explained-maurizio-cattelan-2024) peel.
> 
> Now it’s 4 a.m., and the ranks of the successful and productive are really getting going. Robin Sharma, the self-help guru and author of _The 5 a.m. Club_, is up — “4 a.m. is the new 5 a.m.”, he [told](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/robin-sharma-consistency-interview-2025) _GQ_ recently — for a “victory hour” of “meditation, visualisation and prayer”. [Disney](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/tags/disney-brand) CEO [Bob Iger](https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/i-joined-the-5am-club-it-was-grim-d8b6rfbwl) is ready to begin his morning workout. At 5, Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel is centring himself for 45 minutes of meditation, JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon is flicking through [the first of five newspapers](https://www.wsj.com/story/i-tried-some-intense-ceo-morning-routines-so-you-dont-have-to-a910bc9d), and [Bryan Johnson](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/the-science-behind-biological-age), the tech entrepreneur turned [longevity](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/exercises-for-longevity-workouts) obsessive, is checking his inner ear temperature “to [assess](https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/blogs/news/my-new-morning-routine) if anything is amiss” heath-wise.

> This is funny, given how, historically, a marker of male success was being able to afford to do as little as possible, especially before noon. Glamorous aristocrats and playboys were more likely to be in the casino than the gym in the early hours of the morning. _Sprezzatura_, the Italian concept of effortless, nonchalant grace, was coined in the 16th century and has been invoked ever since. So why has one masculine ideal, of effortlessness and indulgence, been overtaken another, of ceaseless hustle culture?

but the reason cited doesn't seem like a good diagnosis

> In a word: anxiety. Anxiety hums in the background of all these morning routine videos. Even the hyper-precise time stamps and jerky editing instil a baseline level of tension. This new age of male anxiety comes from male success being a rarer beast than it once was.

Arguably, all those popular morning videos are put up by folks who are arguably successful by most metrics. What exactly is making _them_ anxious? I can understand the urge to consume this kind of content and aspiring to an ambitious and elaborate early morning routine, and that stemming from anxiety. But that doesn't seem to be the argument the author is making.

#### Is fitness culture making us sad and boring?
[Is fitness culture making us sad and boring? \| Dazed](https://www.dazeddigital.com/beauty/article/68337/1/is-over-exercise-culture-making-us-sad-and-boring-gym-fitness-social-life) #exercise #fitness #culture 

> Ethan was over-exercising before today’s social media fitness challenges, like [75 Hard](https://andyfrisella.com/pages/75hard-info?srsltid=AfmBOoqO5wmb3frXpZ_fGl4kAyTzOhF_OqXMknQuxbN3uzair93G9Zkc), existed. Still, he exhibited a similarly regimented discipline: working out multiple times a day, sticking to a restrictive diet and swapping social events for “self-improvement” activities. While the broad consensus is that [150 minutes of moderate exercise a week (or half as much if it is intense)](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/06/well/move/30-minutes-exercise.html) – which can equate to about [8,000 steps a day](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667%2821%2900302-9/fulltext) – is enough to lower the risk of premature death and many diseases, this is rarely the message we see plastered across gym inspiration posts online. As fitness influencers proudly proclaim [their gym “addiction”](https://www.tiktok.com/@lahadldnfitness/video/7524010466587413762) causes them to [work out twice a day every day](https://www.tiktok.com/@lucas.kth/video/7449079567886650626) and [high schoolers gloat about skipping prom for a workout](https://www.tiktok.com/@titantraster2.0/video/7500421278499671327?lang=en), getting sucked into extreme gym culture can pull your goals and aspirations away from being well-rounded, interesting and socially connected. So, is over-exercise culture making us sad and boring?

> Over-exercising can also look like using the gym for mood modification, or even emotional avoidance. We see this when people talk about post-breakup “glow-ups” or post about [fighting off “sad girl” season by going to the gym twice a day](https://www.tiktok.com/@ellasandramuse/video/7299180092222262574). “I live such a lonely and boring life that I just spend hours at the gym and go twice a day because I have nothing else better to do and no one to go home to. The gym is one of the only things that can distract me from this void,” [exercise influencer @liftwithspooky wrote on TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@liftwithspooky/video/7260733595843628330). In the comments, there are hundreds of people who share the same routines, and perhaps even go to the same gyms, but never speak to each other. A large part of this has to do with many treating exercise as a means to an end, instead of a potentially enjoyable and connecting experience itself, [downplaying rest days](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/10/well/move/rest-days-gym-fitness.html) and the importance of rest and leisure.
> 
> The mainstream aesthetic-driven approach to going to the gym is, unfortunately, inextricably tied to wellness and diet culture. We often talk about what exercise can do for our bodies, before how it’s enriching our lives and energising us for other things. For this reason, over-exercising tendencies can easily slip through the cracks. “When you talk to a doctor, nobody complains to you about exercising, even though you're overexercising,” says Ethan. “You can hide the brutal reality of it in a self-serving way so that you get to have the aesthetic appeal that you want to develop.” In the midst of a beauty backslide, [where we’re seeing a broader return to conservative, skinny ideals](https://www.dazeddigital.com/beauty/article/66958/1/beauty-backslide-how-the-pendulum-swung-back-to-thinness-and-conservatism), there’s currently a hyper-focus on gaining and maintaining muscle. “This can lead people to make exercise have this really giant role in their life,” says Dr Ertl. “Poor body image continues to be a factor that's linked with exercise addiction and disordered eating generally.”

#### Competitive Exams in India
[Would you pass the world’s toughest exam? | The Economist](https://www.economist.com/interactive/1843/2025/07/24/would-you-pass-the-worlds-toughest-exam?etear=india_nl_1) #exams #india #unemployment 

This article explores the intense and highly competitive railway entrance exams in India, one of the many such exams in India for public sector jobs. The breadth of coverage is very extensive, and the stories are moving. It just left me sad and the desperation and absurdity of the situation.

> Since India started liberalising its economy in the 1990s, its GDP per head has increased eightfold. The country now has the world’s fastest-growing large economy.
> 
> Yet many Indian graduates struggle to find work. According to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) nearly a third of them are jobless. Walk-in interviews draw massive crowds. At the start of this year a video went viral showing thousands of engineers queuing to apply for open positions at a firm in the western city of Pune (local media reported that only 100 were available).
> 
> This is partly an indictment of the education system, which has been criticised for its outdated curriculum and tendency to prioritise rote learning over critical thinking. But it also reflects the fact that the private sector is simply not creating enough jobs for the growing number of graduates, while public-sector jobs continue to be cut.
> 
> For all the buzz around India’s unleashed entrepreneurial spirit, government jobs remain stubbornly popular. They promise a position for life, regardless of competence – a sharp contrast with the precariousness of the private sector. They come with pensions and other benefits. Some offer the chance to augment income through corruption.
> 
> Indian society accords public-sector jobs a special respect. Grooms who have them are able to ask for higher dowries from their brides’ families. “If you are at a wedding and say you have a government job, people will look at you differently,” said Abhishek Singh, an exam tutor in Musallahpur.

#### The worldwide nursing crisis
[The shocking hit film about overworked nurses that’s causing alarm across Europe \| Film \| The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jul/29/late-shift-swiss-hospital-nurses-overworked-healthcare) #nursing #unemployment #caregiving 

This is ostensibly a movie review but I learned more about the nursing crisis than the movie itself.

> The world could face a [shortage of 13 million nurses by the end of this decade](https://nursesinternational.org/2023/05/global-nursing-shortage-by-2030/). For her new film, Swiss director Petra Volpe imagined the consequences of just one missed shift on a busy night at a hospital, and found herself making a disaster movie.
> 
> With Late Shift, Volpe aimed to shine a light on the frontlines of the looming healthcare catastrophe through the eyes of the dedicated, exhausted Floria. Played by German actor Leonie Benesch, the young nurse shows an initially acrobatic grace in her workday, whose first half resembles a particularly hectic episode of the restaurant kitchen series The Bear, but with life-and-death stakes.
