Assembled my [Nuphy Air60 V2](https://nuphy.com/products/air60-v2) keyboard with a custom keycap set. I really like the fact that I can just place it over my laptop keyboard and it just works without any disruption.

> I started my first company 15 years go, and I still can’t manage. I suspect that very few people can. With AngelList, we want a team of self-managing people who ship code.
> 
> Here’s what we do:
> 
> - Keep the team small. All doers, no talkers. Absolutely no middle managers. All BD via APIs.
> - Outsource everything that isn’t core. Resist the urge to pick up that last dollar. Founders do Customer Service.
> - People choose what to work on. Better they ship what they want than not ship what you want.
> - No tasks longer than one week. You have to ship something into live production every week – worst case, two weeks. If you just joined, ship something.
> - Peer-management. Promise what you’ll do in the coming week on internal Yammer. Deliver – or publicly break your promise – next week.
> - One person per project. Get help from others, but you and you alone are accountable.
> 
> If they can’t ship, release them. Our environment is wrong for them. They should go find someplace where they can thrive. There’s someplace for everyone.
