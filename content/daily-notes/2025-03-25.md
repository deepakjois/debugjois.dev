Assembled my [Nuphy Air60 V2](https://nuphy.com/products/air60-v2) keyboard with a custom keycap set. I really like the fact that I can just place it over my laptop keyboard and it just works without any disruption.

#### Build a Team that Ships
[Build a Team that Ships](https://nav.al/build-a-team-that-ships) #software #best-practises

> I started my first company 15 years go, and I still can’t manage. I suspect that very few people can. With AngelList, we want a team of self-managing people who ship code.
> 
> Here’s what we do:
> 
> - Keep the team small. All doers, no talkers. Absolutely no middle managers. All BD via APIs.
> - Outsource everything that isn’t core. Resist the urge to pick up that last dollar. Founders do Customer Service.
> - People choose what to work on. Better they ship what they want than not ship what you want.
> - No tasks longer than one week. You have to ship something into live production every week – worst case, two weeks. If you just joined, ship something.
> - Peer-management. Promise what you’ll do in the coming week on internal Yammer. Deliver – or publicly break your promise – next week.
> - One person per project. Get help from others, but you and you alone are accountable.
> 
> If they can’t ship, release them. Our environment is wrong for them. They should go find someplace where they can thrive. There’s someplace for everyone.

#### Economic Policy of the Trump Administration
[The Parallel Economy and the New Rules of American Power](https://kyla.substack.com/p/the-parallel-economy-and-the-new)

> We have a few forces at work - (1) bot-driven information warfare has distorted our perception of economic reality and (2) seemingly deliberate policy volatility creates conditions for an economic downturn (3) and a Trump 'parallel economy' is positioned is emerging to capitalize on the resulting confusion - perhaps, reducing Trump’s market concerns. Understanding all of this requires unpacking four interconnected phenomena:
> 
> 1. **Bots:** Automated (and hijacked) [information flows](https://restofworld.org/2024/twitter-x-bots-elon-musk-elections/) have created an environment where most people don't know what's factually true anymore
>     
> 2. **Recession**: The administration appears to be intentionally engineering economic volatility as a "necessary detox” as [I wrote about last week](https://kyla.substack.com/p/an-orchestrated-recession-trumps), with JP Morgan [placing recession odds](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr21jjwg4wo) this year rising to 40% and Goldman Sachs to 20%.
>     
> 3. **Parallel Economy**: The [parallel economy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-03-10/donald-trump-jr-and-1789-capital-have-big-plans-for-maga-investing?srnd=homepage-americas) built by Donald Trump Jr. is a reason why President Trump might not care too much about the market selloff.[1](https://kyla.substack.com/p/the-parallel-economy-and-the-new#footnote-1-158735653)
>     
> 4. **Fried Brains**_**:**_ We have ‘temporal dysphoria’. There is a profound mismatch between the pace of information cycles and the ability of humans to adapt to the change in said pace.
>     
> 
> We're living in a reality shaped by automated outrage machines, while facing an economic downturn engineered through deliberate trade policy chaos. As this volatility harms everyday Americans, the Trump family could be positioning itself to profit from a parallel economy. Meanwhile, social media has so thoroughly warped our perception of time that we can no longer process events in a coherent timeline - there’s even a chart for it!
