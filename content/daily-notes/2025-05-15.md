#### The Economy A User's Guide No 2

Here's a **comprehensive, section-by-section summary** of *Part 2* of Brett Scott’s podcast series (co-produced with Lanley Chase). This installment examines **human nature and its influence on economic ideologies**, contrasting the narrow economic conception of humans with a broader, multifaceted perspective. It also introduces key frameworks from economic anthropology.

---

### **1. Introduction**

* **Host**: Brett Scott, author of *Cloud Money* and *The Heretic’s Guide to Global Finance*.
* **Series overview**: A 7-part exploration of the modern economy and capitalism.
* **This episode (Part 2)**: Focuses on *human nature* and how narrow views of it shape economic systems.

---

### **2. The Debate Around Human Nature**

* Philosophers and economists have long debated whether humans are *selfish*, *altruistic*, *rational*, etc.
* **Economics' dominant model**: *Homo economicus* — a portrayal of humans as rational, self-interested, optimization-driven agents.
* Critics argue this model is:

  * Inaccurate.
  * Self-fulfilling: people may begin acting selfishly if they’re told that’s “human nature.”
  * Used to justify exploitation.

**Quote**: “Rather than us trying to disprove *homo economicus*, it's actually much more effective to... argue that we as human beings are in fact multifaceted.”

### **3. A Spectrum of Human Natures**

Scott introduces a spectrum of human archetypes to challenge the singular focus on *homo economicus*. These represent different facets of the human experience:

* **Homo economicus** – Maximizes, optimizes, accumulates.
* **Homo adventurous** – Seeks adventure and thrill.
* **Homo comunus** – Desires connection and love.
* **Homo cogitans** – Reflects, analyzes.
* **Homo absurdum** – Enjoys playfulness and absurdity.
* **Homo reverens** – Approaches life with seriousness and awe.
* **Homo meditari** – Craves emptiness and simplicity.
* **Homo ecologicus** – Feels connected to nature.
* **Homo expressio** – Desires creative expression.
* **Homo shamanicus** – Yearns for mystical, non-rational experiences.
* **Homo eroticus** – Explores intimacy and relational dynamics.
* **Homo fusion** – Wants to dissolve into group identity.
* **Homo inandi** – Seeks dominance and control.
* **Homo protectorus** – Protects others from harm or domination.
* **Homo activusmos** – Feels injustice and seeks to right it.

**Quote**: “We are a whole spectrum of human natures at once... but we're seldom ever taught to think of ourselves like this.”

### **4. How Ideologies Cherry-Pick Human Traits**

Different political and economic ideologies isolate one facet of human nature and treat it as the *whole truth*:

* **Hippie culture** → Love-centered human nature → Eco-villages, communes.
* **Far-right culture** → Domination and fear → Nationalism, protectionism, libertarianism.
* **Communism** → Cooperative nature → Collective ownership and central planning.

These simplified identities shape corresponding **economic visions**.

### **5. Neoliberalism and Homo Economicus**

* **Neoliberalism (post-1980s)** elevates *homo economicus* through deregulation, free markets, and corporate capitalism.
* Common cultural imagery: Thatcher, Reagan, Wall Street, and the ethos of *“greed is good.”*
* While economists acknowledge competitive traits, they wrongly treat them as definitive.
* Even cooperation is sometimes re-explained through self-interest.

**Quote**: “Much like we have five senses... economic life has multiple different logics that coexist.”

### **6. Economic Anthropology: A Broader Lens**

Scott introduces anthropologist David Graeber’s work (*Debt: The First 5000 Years*) to explain that real economies operate under **multiple moral principles simultaneously**, not just market exchange.

#### The Three Moral Principles in Economies:

1. **Everyday Communism**

   * Helping others based on need and capacity, without expecting anything in return.
   * *Examples*: Giving directions, helping someone in distress.

2. **Reciprocity**

   * Equal relationships balanced through mutual exchange.
   * *Examples*: Trading goods, friends cooking for each other.

3. **Hierarchy**

   * Power/status determines who gives and receives, without expectation of reciprocity.
   * *Examples*: Kings distributing gifts, bosses treating employees to dinner.

These principles **often intersect** in complex ways.

---

### **7. Real-Life Examples of Moral Principles Intersecting**

* **Narco gangs**: Distribute groceries (everyday communism), build loyalty and status (hierarchy), funded by exchange-based drug trade (reciprocity).
* **Helping a homeless person with food**: Everyday communism.
* **Friend makes you dinner**: Reciprocity.
* **Boss buys team dinner**: Hierarchy.
* **Airport queue scenarios**:

  * If you're not in a rush, you might let a late passenger go ahead → Everyday communism.
  * If you’re equally stressed, their cutting ahead feels unjust → Reciprocity.
  * If a guard tells everyone to let a disabled person pass → Hierarchy + Communism.

**Quote**: “Capitalist economies foreground reciprocal exchange... but hierarchy and everyday communism abound in the cracks.”

---

### **8. Conclusion and Transition**

* Modern capitalism is complex and mixes these moral principles.
* Most people struggle to define capitalism clearly because they are *immersed* in it.
* Economic anthropology helps us understand what came before capitalism and how alternatives once operated.
* **Next episode**: A look at pre-capitalist systems and how capitalism emerged by displacing them.

**Quote**: “Much like a fish cannot get enough distance from water to see it clearly... we often can't get enough distance from our system to observe it properly.”

---

### **Actionable Takeaways**

* Question singular views of human nature in economics and politics.
* Reflect on your own interactions: Are they governed by exchange, generosity, or hierarchy?
* Explore anthropological works (e.g., Graeber’s *Debt*) to understand diverse economic systems.
* Be cautious of ideologies that simplify humanity to one trait or motive.
