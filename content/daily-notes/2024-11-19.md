> This morning, The Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan research organization, [published a deep 122 page report](https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2024/11/18/americas-news-influencers/) that found that the news influencer landscape skews male and leans disproportionately conservative, creating a concerning imbalance in our online news landscape that could ultimately have profound political consequences.

…

> In a media environment where about [4 in 10 adults under 30 regularly get news from news content creators](https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2024/11/18/americas-news-influencers/), this imbalance isn’t just inequitable—it’s a systemic distortion of public discourse that ultimately undermines democratic values, entrenches conservative messaging, and accelerates polarization. I've written before about [how desperately the left needs to build an infrastructure to amass online influence](https://www.usermag.co/p/why-democrats-wont-build-their-own), these stats highlight just how urgent that mission is.

[don't deceive yourself - by Celine Nguyen - personal canon](https://www.personalcanon.com/p/dont-deceive-yourself)

Only recently started following Celine Nguyen on Substack, but her essays contain detailed analysis and lovely references.

> I used to be jealous of the people who seemed to just _write_ more, _do_ more, _make_ more work than me! But lately I’ve realized that, while some are lucky to have an easier life (the prototypical trust fund kids, for example)…many of those people, in Didion’s words, knew the price of things. They wanted to make certain projects happen, and embraced the consequences.
