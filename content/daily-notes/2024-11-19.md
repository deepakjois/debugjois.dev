#### Conservative News Influencers
[The majority of news influencers are conservative men, study finds](https://www.usermag.co/p/the-majority-of-news-influencers)

> This morning, The Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan research organization, [published a deep 122 page report](https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2024/11/18/americas-news-influencers/) that found that the news influencer landscape skews male and leans disproportionately conservative, creating a concerning imbalance in our online news landscape that could ultimately have profound political consequences.

…

> In a media environment where about [4 in 10 adults under 30 regularly get news from news content creators](https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2024/11/18/americas-news-influencers/), this imbalance isn’t just inequitable—it’s a systemic distortion of public discourse that ultimately undermines democratic values, entrenches conservative messaging, and accelerates polarization. I've written before about [how desperately the left needs to build an infrastructure to amass online influence](https://www.usermag.co/p/why-democrats-wont-build-their-own), these stats highlight just how urgent that mission is.

and a surprising tidbit about how TikTok is actually an exception in some ways

> Politically, TikTok also bucks the trend: it’s the only platform where right-leaning news influencers (25%) do not outnumber left-leaning ones (28%). TikTok also has a higher concentration of news content creators who identify as LGBTQ+ or advocate for LGBTQ+ rights (13%), which is more than double the proportion on other platforms.

> As I've written previously, TikTok [remains a hub for progressive activism online](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/06/13/influencers-biden-tiktok-ban/). But unfortunately, this has [made the app the target of right wing ire and directly fed efforts to shut it down](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/mar/16/tiktok-ban-progressive-politics-activism).

#### Don't Deceive Yourself
[don't deceive yourself - by Celine Nguyen - personal canon](https://www.personalcanon.com/p/dont-deceive-yourself)

Only recently started following Celine Nguyen on Substack, but her essays contain detailed analysis and lovely references.

> I used to be jealous of the people who seemed to just _write_ more, _do_ more, _make_ more work than me! But lately I’ve realized that, while some are lucky to have an easier life (the prototypical trust fund kids, for example)…many of those people, in Didion’s words, knew the price of things. They wanted to make certain projects happen, and embraced the consequences.

#### The Stone Soup Theory of Billionaires
[The Stone Soup Theory of Billionaires - by Brett Scott](https://www.asomo.co/p/the-stone-soup-theory-of-billionaires) #money #anthropology 

This is a powerful counter-narrative to the prevailing gospel which worships billionaires and their achievements. I will quote the intro in full, but the whole article is worth reading.

> In recent years there’s been a strong outbreak of the [Great Man Theory of History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory). This is the idea that single powerful or inspired men - literally men - create history and should be adored, or, on the flip side, reviled. Trump is obviously one of these people, but so too is Musk, Bezos, Putin, and so on. Regardless of whether they’re imagined as superheroes or supervillains, it’s assumed that the future somehow springs fully-formed out of them.
> 
> When you imagine that the course of history uniquely resides in single individuals like this, you also imagine that slight shifts in their decisions affect everything for the rest of time. They’re like the star characters in a great global soap opera, but one in which nobody else has any role but to watch them, and either praise or condemn their actions.
>
> This same style of thinking is often applied to their wealth. The Great Man Theory of Wealth assumes that extreme riches are the result of inspired work that the person undertakes. If Bezos had not got up one morning in 1994 and had an idea for Amazon.com, we’d never have a global e-commerce platform. I mean, there are only 8.2 billion of us on the planet. Surely, the chances of a _second_ person working out that you could match buyers and sellers on the Internet is incredibly small!
>
> It’s always imagined that the Great Man _builds_ something. He _built_ a nation. He _built_ a company. This isn’t the full reality. Here’s what actually happens: _other people_ mostly build the thing, and the role of the Great Man is simply to be the focal point around which it’s built. To understand this, let’s turn to the parable of the Stone Soup.

He further goes on to break down and rebut several arguments that support the idea that somehow these billionaires deserve the wealth that they have acquired.
