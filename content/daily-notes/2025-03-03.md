#### Erotic Writing

> But eroticism is changing. Open “Onyx Storm”, the latest [romantasy](https://www.economist.com/culture/2024/04/26/romantasy-brings-dragons-and-eroticism-together-at-last) book (a genre that blends romance and fantasy) by Rebecca Yarros, and things are rather clearer. Hardy perennials are out. Words like “hard” are in—as too are words including “cock”, “fuck” and “straddle”. And people are buying it. Sales of erotica are booming: thanks to pre-orders, “Onyx Storm” had already been on Amazon’s bestseller list for 19 weeks by the time it was published in January. After release, it shifted almost 3m copies in a week. It sold faster than any novel in America in the past 20 years.

> There is now a vast variety of erotica available, including cosy erotica (knitwear is torn off), Austen erotica ([Mr Darcy](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2024/11/19/jane-austen-still-universally-acknowledged-at-250) has assets even more impressive than £10,000 a year) and fairy erotica. There is even erotica featuring—readers may wish to brace themselves—physicists. These titles contain such explicit lines as, “Your dissertation on liquid crystals’ static distortions in biaxial nematics was brilliant, Elsie.”

> What has driven this is new digital formats, such as audiobooks. (Ms Yarros and Ms Maas dominate those charts, too.) The e-book has been especially consequential. It is discreet—no one can see what you are reading on a tablet. And it lets authors self-publish cheaply, as Ms James did in 2011 with “Fifty Shades of Grey”, a story of sadomasochism. It was later republished by Vintage, but romance lovers retained the habit of reading books digitally.

>Authorial autonomy online means it is “impossible to police” what goes into books, says Hal Gladfelder of the University of Manchester. The ubiquity of internet [porn](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2025/01/15/should-you-have-to-prove-your-age-before-watching-porn)[ography](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2025/01/15/should-you-have-to-prove-your-age-before-watching-porn) means that even to try to do so would feel “ridiculous”.

In one sense this new generation of erotic prose is more realistic than what came before. Floral analogies are out; proper body parts are in. But in another sense, it is not remotely realistic. Everyone is gorgeous; names like “Xaden” and “Aetos” dominate; most characters have remarkable powers, if not superpowers.
