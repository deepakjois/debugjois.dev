#### Erotic Writing
[Erotic writing is becoming more explicit](https://www.economist.com/culture/2025/02/27/erotic-writing-is-becoming-more-explicit) #erotica #books #literature 

But eroticism is changing. Open “Onyx Storm”, the latest [romantasy](https://www.economist.com/culture/2024/04/26/romantasy-brings-dragons-and-eroticism-together-at-last) book (a genre that blends romance and fantasy) by Rebecca Yarros, and things are rather clearer. Hardy perennials are out. Words like “hard” are in—as too are words including “cock”, “fuck” and “straddle”. And people are buying it. Sales of erotica are booming: thanks to pre-orders, “Onyx Storm” had already been on Amazon’s bestseller list for 19 weeks by the time it was published in January. After release, it shifted almost 3m copies in a week. It sold faster than any novel in America in the past 20 years.

There is now a vast variety of erotica available, including cosy erotica (knitwear is torn off), Austen erotica ([Mr Darcy](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2024/11/19/jane-austen-still-universally-acknowledged-at-250) has assets even more impressive than £10,000 a year) and fairy erotica. There is even erotica featuring—readers may wish to brace themselves—physicists. These titles contain such explicit lines as, “Your dissertation on liquid crystals’ static distortions in biaxial nematics was brilliant, Elsie.”
