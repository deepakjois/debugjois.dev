#### Erotic Writing
[Erotic writing is becoming more explicit](https://www.economist.com/culture/2025/02/27/erotic-writing-is-becoming-more-explicit) #erotica #books #literature 

> But eroticism is changing. Open “Onyx Storm”, the latest [romantasy](https://www.economist.com/culture/2024/04/26/romantasy-brings-dragons-and-eroticism-together-at-last) book (a genre that blends romance and fantasy) by Rebecca Yarros, and things are rather clearer. Hardy perennials are out. Words like “hard” are in—as too are words including “cock”, “fuck” and “straddle”. And people are buying it. Sales of erotica are booming: thanks to pre-orders, “Onyx Storm” had already been on Amazon’s bestseller list for 19 weeks by the time it was published in January. After release, it shifted almost 3m copies in a week. It sold faster than any novel in America in the past 20 years.

> There is now a vast variety of erotica available, including cosy erotica (knitwear is torn off), Austen erotica ([Mr Darcy](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2024/11/19/jane-austen-still-universally-acknowledged-at-250) has assets even more impressive than £10,000 a year) and fairy erotica. There is even erotica featuring—readers may wish to brace themselves—physicists. These titles contain such explicit lines as, “Your dissertation on liquid crystals’ static distortions in biaxial nematics was brilliant, Elsie.”

> What has driven this is new digital formats, such as audiobooks. (Ms Yarros and Ms Maas dominate those charts, too.) The e-book has been especially consequential. It is discreet—no one can see what you are reading on a tablet. And it lets authors self-publish cheaply, as Ms James did in 2011 with “Fifty Shades of Grey”, a story of sadomasochism. It was later republished by Vintage, but romance lovers retained the habit of reading books digitally.

> Authorial autonomy online means it is “impossible to police” what goes into books, says Hal Gladfelder of the University of Manchester. The ubiquity of internet [porn](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2025/01/15/should-you-have-to-prove-your-age-before-watching-porn)[ography](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2025/01/15/should-you-have-to-prove-your-age-before-watching-porn) means that even to try to do so would feel “ridiculous”.

> In one sense this new generation of erotic prose is more realistic than what came before. Floral analogies are out; proper body parts are in. But in another sense, it is not remotely realistic. Everyone is gorgeous; names like “Xaden” and “Aetos” dominate; most characters have remarkable powers, if not superpowers.

#### Crypto Bailout By Trump

And although many still describe bitcoin as “digital gold”, believing that it should serve as a hedge against economic turmoil in similar ways as some people view actual gold, bitcoin and other crypto assets are once again demonstrating that they are among some of the first assets to decline among broader economic uncertainty. With looming tariffs by the Trump administration against Canada, Mexico, and China, concerns from the Federal Reserve about those and other policies’ impacts on inflation, and continuing wobbles in the labor market, people are selling off risky assets like crypto in hopes of better weathering the economic storm on the horizon. The comparatively new bitcoin ETFs set new records for the highest single-day outflows on February 25, with investors withdrawing more than $1 billion in total from the eleven ETFs.[3](https://www.citationneeded.news/issue-78/#reference-3)

Seeming to respond to the panicked pleas from the cryptocurrency industry, Trump rescued bitcoin from its below-$80,000 slide in a Sunday Truth Social post reiterating his plans for a “U.S. Crypto Reserve”, which he added would contain “XRP [Ripple], SOL [Solana], and ADA [Cardano]”. Further panic [[__I74__](https://www.citationneeded.news/issue-74/#in-elections-and-political-influence)__,__ [__75__](https://www.citationneeded.news/issue-75/#crypto-executive-order)] from bitcoin maximalists likely prompted his quick addendum two hours later that “And, obviously, BTC and ETH, as other valuable Cryptocurrencies, will be the heart of the Reserve. I also love Bitcoin and Ethereum!” Nice save.[4](https://www.citationneeded.news/issue-78/#reference-4)
