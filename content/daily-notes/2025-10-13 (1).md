#### The Bay Area is cursed

> The Bay Area has a curse. It is the curse of Aboutness. Social life here is not regarded as something people do naturally, an organic element of being. It has to be About something. In New York, it’s an important component of the human repertoire to dress up nicely, gather, drink and eat, be part of the throng. In the Bay, most gatherings have the sweaty air of Purpose. Discussions are held to uncover new information, not because it is good to be around each other. Conversations feel like podcasts and the hosts are not funny. Someone recently said to me: “I’m tired of drinking in living rooms with overly smart people.”

> People are dreaming up the future here, who have never fully experienced their own bodies or emotions. They talk philosophically about how to reshape society, but don’t know what society feels like. They’ve never been able to rely on peers, or receive care informally. San Francisco is an avoidant city, and Berkeley is an anxious colony. The most awkward people I’ve ever met write widely read posts about the secrets of charisma and attraction. Psychology is one topic haunting the city here, because so many have a rough go of it. But the main topic is, of course, AI. A friend’s group house had “days since AI mentioned” as a counter written on the whiteboard, I never saw the number rise above 2.

#### Why are young people getting married again?

> To clarify, Shannon is not saying that marriage is inherently right-wing, but that it is perceived as conservative and traditional because of its long patriarchal history. In her book, _Marriage, A History_, Stephanie Coontz [quotes](https://www.theswaddle.com/marriage-is-an-inherently-unfeminist-institution) historian Margaret Hunt, who states that marriage was “the main means of transferring property, occupational status, personal contacts, money, tools, livestock and _women_ across generations, and kin groups.” To this day, it is men who benefit from marriage, as Clementine Ford highlights in her article: “[Marriage is an inherently misogynistic institution – so why do women agree to it?](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/oct/31/marriage-is-an-inherently-misogynistic-institution-so-why-do-women-agree-to-it)”, as reports show that [married men live longer than married women](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/aug/03/women-may-not-live-longer-than-men-after-all-study), are generally [happier and healthier](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/marriage-and-mens-health) and see their [economic prospects improve](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41236581).


> Our parents’ behaviour often makes us roll our eyes in annoyance, but their hold over our lives is far-reaching. It can feel wrong to defy their expectations, not just because they are our parents but because, as [Michel Foucault](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/hypatia/article/abs/foucault-and-familial-power/CE3EAD6AC958516480CD6778406A3EA7) argues, the family is now a site of key sovereign power (as we no longer rely on the monarchy or religion as heavily as we used to). As a result, the family serves as a disciplinary apparatus that actively (and effectively) enforces social norms and self-discipline.


> 26-year-old Gillian feels coerced into marriage, not through pressures from her family but because of Labour’s new dehumanising and classist immigration policies. “I never really thought about marriage until the [White Paper](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restoring-control-over-the-immigration-system-white-paper) this past May upped the salary minimum for a work visa from [£29K to £41K](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa/your-job). I came here on a student visa, met my lovely boyfriend, got a full-time job, and was on a steady work visa. Suddenly, I was ineligible to renew, and one of the only routes to staying is a spouse visa.” She continues: “It puts an insane amount of pressure on our lives… Neither of us really believes in marriage, but the legal privilege of being married has become something of a defining factor in preserving my life.”
