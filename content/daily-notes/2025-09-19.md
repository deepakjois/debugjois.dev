#### A string of beads

> Obviously, you don’t need me to tell you these are dark, unsettling, apocalyptic times. Almost everyone in my British and American social circles seems rattled by the shooting of Charlie Kirk and the ensuing crackdown on expression in the US, and/or by the resurgence of nativism and anti-migrant feeling in the UK, all of it unfolding on top of ongoing horrors in Gaza, climate instability, and the possibility that artificial intelligence might kill us all.
> 
> There’s an unmoored sense of anxiety, a deer-in-the-headlights paralysis – the feeling that there’s little to be done about any of this, yet that it’s impossible to concentrate on anything else instead. Even people with a talent for shutting out the headlines seem troubled by a sense of reality crowding in on them, or maybe pulling the rug from beneath them, making it harder than ever to pursue the projects and relationships that add up to a rich and absorbing life.
> 
> I trust you won’t be shocked to learn that I don’t have a conclusive answer for dealing with any of this. But there’s an image I find surprisingly liberating – actively useful and perspective-shifting, I mean, not merely consoling – that’s worth unpacking here. It’s the idea of seeing the actions you take from hour to hour, through the day, as a matter of **threading beads onto a string, as if you were making a necklace.**

> This has a strange side effect. Musicians are turned into influencers—because their social media success is more likely to generate “follows” instead of “streams.”
> 
> There was once a big difference between a musician and a fashion model or comedian or pundit. But now they all compete against each other on the same reels for the same audience.
> 
> So here are the new rules of the game:
> 
> 1. Artists no longer exist.
> 2. They have been turned into _content creators_ for tech companies.
> 3. The platforms have an insatiable appetite for content—but they don’t care if it’s music or a goofy joke or a violent crime or anything else that gets attention for a few seconds.
> 4. You can’t entrust art forms and creative idioms to these platforms, but somehow they now possess life-or-death control over all of them.
> 
> If you’re a musician, that’s not a happy state of affairs.
