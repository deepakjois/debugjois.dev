#### A string of beads

> Obviously, you don’t need me to tell you these are dark, unsettling, apocalyptic times. Almost everyone in my British and American social circles seems rattled by the shooting of Charlie Kirk and the ensuing crackdown on expression in the US, and/or by the resurgence of nativism and anti-migrant feeling in the UK, all of it unfolding on top of ongoing horrors in Gaza, climate instability, and the possibility that artificial intelligence might kill us all.
> 
> There’s an unmoored sense of anxiety, a deer-in-the-headlights paralysis – the feeling that there’s little to be done about any of this, yet that it’s impossible to concentrate on anything else instead. Even people with a talent for shutting out the headlines seem troubled by a sense of reality crowding in on them, or maybe pulling the rug from beneath them, making it harder than ever to pursue the projects and relationships that add up to a rich and absorbing life.
> 
> I trust you won’t be shocked to learn that I don’t have a conclusive answer for dealing with any of this. But there’s an image I find surprisingly liberating – actively useful and perspective-shifting, I mean, not merely consoling – that’s worth unpacking here. It’s the idea of seeing the actions you take from hour to hour, through the day, as a matter of **threading beads onto a string, as if you were making a necklace.**
