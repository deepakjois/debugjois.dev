#### A string of beads
[The Imperfectionist: A string of beads](https://ckarchive.com/b/75u7h8h699kkzb6rgg7rlawl85666tnhordn0)

> Obviously, you don’t need me to tell you these are dark, unsettling, apocalyptic times. Almost everyone in my British and American social circles seems rattled by the shooting of Charlie Kirk and the ensuing crackdown on expression in the US, and/or by the resurgence of nativism and anti-migrant feeling in the UK, all of it unfolding on top of ongoing horrors in Gaza, climate instability, and the possibility that artificial intelligence might kill us all.
> 
> There’s an unmoored sense of anxiety, a deer-in-the-headlights paralysis – the feeling that there’s little to be done about any of this, yet that it’s impossible to concentrate on anything else instead. Even people with a talent for shutting out the headlines seem troubled by a sense of reality crowding in on them, or maybe pulling the rug from beneath them, making it harder than ever to pursue the projects and relationships that add up to a rich and absorbing life.
> 
> I trust you won’t be shocked to learn that I don’t have a conclusive answer for dealing with any of this. But there’s an image I find surprisingly liberating – actively useful and perspective-shifting, I mean, not merely consoling – that’s worth unpacking here. It’s the idea of seeing the actions you take from hour to hour, through the day, as a matter of **threading beads onto a string, as if you were making a necklace.**

#### Listeners Can't Remember the Names of Their Favorite Songs and Artists

> This has a strange side effect. Musicians are turned into influencers—because their social media success is more likely to generate “follows” instead of “streams.”
> 
> There was once a big difference between a musician and a fashion model or comedian or pundit. But now they all compete against each other on the same reels for the same audience.
> 
> So here are the new rules of the game:
> 
> 1. Artists no longer exist.
> 2. They have been turned into _content creators_ for tech companies.
> 3. The platforms have an insatiable appetite for content—but they don’t care if it’s music or a goofy joke or a violent crime or anything else that gets attention for a few seconds.
> 4. You can’t entrust art forms and creative idioms to these platforms, but somehow they now possess life-or-death control over all of them.
> 
> If you’re a musician, that’s not a happy state of affairs.

#### Litti Chokha
[Why Is Bihar’s Litti-Chokha Still Invisible in India’s Food Story? — GOYA](https://www.goya.in/blog/why-is-bihars-litti-chokha-still-invisible-in-indias-food-story) #food #bihar 

A beautiful description of Litti Chokha, one of my favorite foods.

> If you’re in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, or nearby states, you won’t have to search too hard to find litti chokha. Just look for establishments with lights bright enough to illuminate the street, little hole-in-the-wall shops, wobbly carts, or a pavement not being used for walking, and you will find it.
> 
> A plate of litti-chokha is simple. Litti is a ball of dough, kneaded with salt, ajwain, and some fat, filled with crumbly sattu (roasted Bengal gram flour). The sattu is combined with garlic, green chilies, coriander, salt, and a dash of pickle oil. Some will put enough garlic to repel a vampire. Chokha is a mash of roasted eggplants, boiled potatoes, coriander leaves, green chilies, onions, and most importantly, uncooked, raw, pungent, eye-watering mustard oil. Now every place might not offer you a green chutney, because litti chokha doesn't really need a third wheel.
> 
> Interesting to note is that besan and sattu are both made from Bengal gram, which is soaked and dried in the sun. For besan, you grind the dried Bengal gram. For sattu, you roast the Bengal gram in a wok filled with sand, and grind the legume along with the husk. This roasting process is what makes sattu a ready-to-eat meal.

#### How to figure out what to believe
[Thuggistry - by Rob Kurzban - Living Fossils](https://thelivingfossils.substack.com/p/thuggistry)

> This post is about how to figure out what to believe.
> 
> Philosophers have a word for this issue, _epistemology_, the study of how to figure out what is true. My experience as a scientist made me, epistemologically, quite skeptical. I was in a meeting some time ago with people in Philadelphia city government and someone said that such and such must be the case because they saw the finding in a peer-reviewed journal. I regret how hard I laughed because it was otherwise a pretty somber meeting.
> 
> From an evolutionary perspective, figuring out what to believe is actually a tough problem. Humans need to learn from others, so they have to believe at least some of what others say, but they also don’t want to believe just _anything_.

#### 6 Economic Lessons from Books About Power, Propaganda, and Decline

Kyla Scanlon deployes René Girard's mimetic theory to make sense of the current zeitgeist.

> For both cases, death became a partisan talking point. René Girard's mimetic theory helps explain what's happening here.
> 
> - Human desire is imitative - we want what others want (the business model of social media), which creates escalating conflicts as people compete for the same objects of desire.
> - This mimetic rivalry builds tension until it threatens to tear communities apart.
> - The ancient solution was scapegoating: the community would unanimously direct their violence toward a single (perhaps innocent) victim, achieving peace through shared blame.
> - It worked because it required unanimity.
> - Everyone had to agree, at least publicly, on who was responsible for their troubles and that collective accusation created social cohesion, even if it was built on a lie.
> 
> But online, that type of unanimity is structurally impossible. The same tragic event gets processed through completely different frameworks all at once. Murder becomes a way to validate an existing worldview and reinforce a sense of moral superiority. Digital scapegoating amplifies it across feeds. Tragedy becomes content.

> Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;  
> Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,  
> The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere  
> The ceremony of innocence is drowned;  
> The best lack all conviction, while the worst  
> Are full of passionate intensity.

#### Self-Exploiting Worker
[Self-exploiting workers \| A Working Library](https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/self-exploiting-workers)

Mandy Brown quotes Byung-Chul Han

> In an essay titled, “Why Revolution is Impossible Today,” Byung-Chul Han writes:
> 
> > The system-preserving power of the disciplinary, industrial society was oppressive. Factory workers were brutally exploited by factory owners, and this violent exploitation prompted protest and resistance. In that situation, a revolution that would overturn the ruling relations of production was a possibility. In that system, it was clear who the oppressors, as well as the oppressed, were. There was a concrete opponent, a visible enemy who could serve as the target of resistance.
> > 
> > The neoliberal system of rule is structured in an altogether different fashion. The system-preserving power is no longer oppressive but seductive. It is no longer as clearly visible as it had been under the disciplinary regime. There is no longer a concrete opponent, no one who is taking away the freedom of the people, no oppressor to be resisted.
> > 
> > Out of the oppressed worker, neoliberalism creates the free entrepreneur, the entrepreneur of the self. Today, everyone is a self-exploiting worker in his own enterprise. Everyone is both master and slave. The class struggle has been transformed into an internal struggle against oneself. Those who fail blame themselves and feel ashamed. People see themselves, rather than society, as the problem.
> > 
> > Disciplinary power, attempting to control people by force, by subjecting them to a dense matrix of orders and prohibitions, is inefficient. Much more efficient is that technique of power that ensures that people subordinate themselves to the system of rule voluntarily.
> > 
> > [Han, _Capitalism and the Death Drive_, page 16](https://aworkinglibrary.com/reading/capitalism-and-the-death-drive)
> 
> Han has previously written about the “entrepreneur of the self” in _[The Burnout Society](https://aworkinglibrary.com/reading/burnout-society), _which connects such self-exploitation to its inevitable outcome. The turn, here, is to note that what’s burned up is both the individual worker _and_ the collective they might have belonged to. That is, when the worker absorbs the management ethos and becomes their own manager—when they see themselves as a project to be designed, branded, and marketed—they lose all sense of solidarity with other workers. Other workers become competitors instead of comrades. And everyone loses.
