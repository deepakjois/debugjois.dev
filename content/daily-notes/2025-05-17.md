> At the heart of the transformation is the rise of trendy new cafés, driven by the demands of a young, educated population that may not have significant wealth but has an undeniable passion for socialising in different spaces and feeling connected to global trends.

> In Tehran and other major cities here, café culture has exploded. Although there’s still much ground to cover and quality to improve, this culinary upheaval is as much about reclaiming identity as it is about embracing the rest of the world.

> “Everybody is creating cracks in the wall of fanaticism, even those linked to the political system, whether they’re aware of it or not,” said one person in the sector. “Look at how alive the city is at a very difficult time. And this is thanks to these cafés, theatres and art galleries.”
