Janan Ganesh has a nice set of tips for travel

>  First, the journey itself. Carry-on is a mistake. The time saved in baggage claim at the other end isn’t worth the stress of finding overhead storage space. Even for business class passengers, with their dedicated lockers, it is still better to move around an airport unencumbered. This is meant to be a break, not arm day.

> Beware the “authentic” experience. This is the ultimate intellectual trap. At least in countries with a decent-sized middle class, “real” life will be less distinctive than the visitor hopes or imagines. In much of south-east Asia, it is authentic behaviour to spend time in malls. First, because these are air conditioned. Second, because countries with fresh memories of being poor tend not to regard material consumption with ennui or distaste. By all means, in Bangkok, ride the canal boat. But don’t kid yourself that it is truer to local experience than taking mass transit from a suburban new-build to a nine-hour office shift. In a Gulf city, do visit the “old town”. But remember that it is the old town precisely because it is divorced from how lives are lived now. 
> 
> If an Asian visitor cycled through Paris in a striped top and an onion necklace, saying “ooh là là” at intervals, we wouldn’t think, “There goes someone who has mastered the local culture.” We’d know that real Parisians are doing banal things. But westerners, especially the educated ones, can make the same error of over-romanticisation in other places. It is the supposed suckers in the tourist traps who are often clearer-headed about what they want and are getting out of their trip.

> It is a point that flows into the largest of all lessons about travel. Don’t expect it to be educational. At worst, it can go the other way, in that you over-index what you happen to see in person. (“I went to Russia and it was sweetness itself,” was a widely heard sentiment between the 2018 World Cup and the war in Ukraine.) It is better to be merely ignorant of a place than confidently wrong about it. If you travel a fair bit, those who don’t can go all sheepish and deferent around you. This advantage is unwarranted, which isn’t to say I make no use of it.

#### Power and Heirarchy

Loved this article, even though I only read the ChatGPT summary, which I am reproducing below

> This article explores the nature of power hierarchies, emphasizing that rulers depend on key supporters whose loyalty must be maintained through resource distribution. It discusses how status and identity are deeply intertwined with navigating multiple overlapping hierarchies and how toxic power dynamics, such as those in cults, isolate individuals by cutting off other sources of status and identity.
> 
> **Key Takeaways**
> 
> • Power depends on maintaining loyalty of key supporters by distributing resources strategically.
> 
> • Status is relative and context-dependent, shaped by multiple overlapping hierarchies.
> 
> • Toxic power, like in cults, isolates individuals by restricting access to alternative hierarchies, causing trauma upon exit.
> 
> **Theme Wise Breakdown**
> 
> **Misconceptions About Historical Power**
> 
> The author reflects on their initial naive belief that kings ruled absolutely, only to learn that historical rulers had precarious positions dependent on keeping their councils and armies loyal. Using the example of Roman emperors, the author highlights the constant threat of being overthrown or assassinated if key supporters were dissatisfied.
> 
> **Rules for Rulers: The Role of Keys in Power**
> 
> Summarizing CGP Grey’s "Rules for Rulers," the article explains that rulers cannot govern alone and must rely on "keys" — people controlling military, finances, etc. The ruler’s primary job is managing treasure flow to keep these keys loyal, as keys can defect if rivals offer better rewards. This creates an incentive to minimize the number of keys to maximize loyalty, explaining why dictators purge former allies after gaining power.
> 
> **The Fractal Nature of Hierarchies**
> 
> Power dynamics repeat at every level: each key manages their own subordinates similarly, balancing resources to maintain loyalty. If a key fails to satisfy their subordinates, they risk being overthrown themselves, creating a fractal pattern of power maintenance.
> 
> **Benedict Arnold: A Case Study in Key Loyalty and Betrayal**
> 
> Benedict Arnold’s story illustrates the consequences of a key feeling undervalued. Despite his heroism, Arnold was repeatedly denied deserved promotions and recognition, leading him to consider defecting to the opposing side. This exemplifies how keys may overthrow or abandon leaders who do not reward them properly.
> 
> **Status as Hierarchy Competition**
> 
> Status is not absolute but depends on which hierarchy one is competing in. People gain status by possessing what others in their relevant social group value. The author notes that status is more visible when gaps between ranks are large (e.g., celebrities) but often subtle and overlapping in everyday life, leading to plausible deniability about rank differences.
> 
> **Navigating Multiple Overlapping Hierarchies**
> 
> Individuals simultaneously compete in many hierarchies, some large and some niche. People tend to care about status in hierarchies relevant to their social circles. The author shares personal examples from polyamory, where jealousy arises when others encroach on one’s status in specific hierarchies, but comfort is found in having unique advantages in others.
> 
> **Identity as a Product of Hierarchy Competition**
> 
> The author reflects on how much of personal identity is shaped by social positioning within hierarchies. Preferences and self-concepts often serve as strategies to secure social safety and status. Even seeming immune to status is itself a high-status position. The author acknowledges that identity is largely strategic but hints at some genuine aspects to be discussed later.
> 
> **Formative Years and Hierarchy Selection**
> 
> During development, people explore which hierarchies they can succeed in and gravitate toward those that fit their traits. For example, athletic ability might lead to joining a sports team, while personality traits might align with certain social groups. This process shapes social identity and status.
> 
> **Status Competition in Everyday Life**
> 
> Social interactions often involve subtle battles over which hierarchies to prioritize. People try to pull others into hierarchies where they rank higher by emphasizing their expertise or values. Avoiding low status in unfamiliar hierarchies explains why people stick to familiar social groups or niches.
> 
> **Toxic Power and Cults**
> 
> The author discusses cults as extreme examples of toxic power, where leaders isolate followers by cutting off access to all other hierarchies. This monopolization of loyalty prevents subordinates from gaining alternative sources of status or identity, making them more exploitable. Cults justify isolation as a gift or sacrifice for a greater goal.
> 
> **Trauma of Leaving Cults**
> 
> Leaving a cult is traumatic because individuals transition from a narrow, controlled hierarchy to a vast world of many hierarchies where they lack status or skills. Betrayal by trusted leaders compounds this trauma, as does the loss of identity and social support.
> 
> **Frame Control and Hierarchy Manipulation**
> 
> Cults use frame control to keep followers within their hierarchy by denying legitimacy to outside influences. This control is a form of power that prevents followers from recognizing or accessing alternative sources of value and status.
> 
> **Final Reflections on Status, Anxiety, and Identity**
> 
> The author connects social anxiety to low status, noting that rising in status reduces anxiety and increases confidence. They also question how much of the self is constructed through social strategies versus genuine preference, concluding that identity is mostly strategic but not entirely so.
