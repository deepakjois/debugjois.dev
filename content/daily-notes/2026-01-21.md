> Just two brief stops on the Tokyo Metro away from the incessant energy of Shibuya sits the district of Sangenjaya—a youth-oriented neighborhood characterized by its station-side maze of winding alleyways crowded with bars and hidden eateries, a thriving community of both local and international students milling in the streets, and a collective of young creatives opening up shop. Fueling this ever-present undercurrent of vitality in Sangenjaya are countless cafes, each seeking a precarious balance between preserving traditions and pioneering innovations.

> Sangenjaya exists, sandwiched between buzzing neighborhoods like bustling Shibuya and youth-oriented, trend-loving Shimokitazawa, as a laid-back location where the quiet magic happens. More than just the hometown of one of Tokyo’s most lauded roasters, Sangenjaya plays host to a coterie of atmospheric and innovative cafes, all of which provide delightful spots to sip, snack, and soak in the charm of one of Tokyo’s most beloved enclaves.
