#### The gap between a Helpful Assistant and a Senior Engineer

> One of the important functions of a senior engineer is to be able to evaluate the context a software project lives in and figure out if we need to do something, even if it isn’t explicitly asked for. This is contrast to a helpful assistant, who is first and foremost obligated to _follow the user’s instructions._ This leads to a gap between a Helpful Assistant and a Senior Engineer.

> Well, imagine a human L7 engineer who has just been hired by a big tech company to head up some big, new, multi-year initiative. Will they say, “Sure, I can help with that!” and start busily coding away? Of course not: they will go out and start reviewing code, reading docs, talking to people, asking questions, shadowing oncalls, doing small starter tasks–they will start by going out and building context. Here, the “helpful assistant” frame for LLMs is limiting: sure, Claude might ask you a few questions to clarify the task upfront, but if your coding agent starts asking you about “relevant partner teams” and “org-wide priorities for this half” you are definitely going to raise an eyebrow.
