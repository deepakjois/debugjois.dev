#### You're Not Interviewing for the Job. You're Auditioning for the Job Title

> I once read that "a complex system usually reflects an absence of good design." It's brilliant. True. And if you're prepping for a system design interview, forget it immediately.
> 
> In real-world engineering, simplicity is king. In interviews, **complexity is currency.**
> 
> Job interviews aren't assessments. They're auditions for a job title: **The Architect Who Solves Hard Problems™.**
> 
> You're not being evaluated on whether you can build the described system efficiently. You're being evaluated on whether you can **perform the role** of someone who could theoretically build Google.


> I'm not advocating dishonesty, I'm acknowledging reality. Interviews are a ritual, and rituals have rules. Here's how to navigate them:
> 
> **Separate Performance from Practice**: Playing the interview game doesn't make you a hypocrite. It makes you pragmatic about a broken system. You can excel at interview theater while still being a principled engineer once you're hired.
> 
> **Learn the Sacred Texts**: Study distributed systems patterns even if you'll never use them. Memorize the CAP theorem even if it's mostly irrelevant to your daily work. Practice drawing architecture diagrams that look impressive on whiteboards. Think of it as learning a foreign language you'll only speak during interviews.
> 
> **Embrace the Tropes**: Always start discussions with "At scale, we'd need to consider..." Mention monitoring and observability early and often, even for simple systems. Add redundancy everywhere, even for non-critical components. Use the magic words that signal competence in interview-land.
> 
> **Then Drop the Act**: Once hired, advocate ruthlessly for simplicity. Be the voice of reason who asks "Do we actually need this complexity?" Use your hard-earned credibility to push back against unnecessary over-engineering. This is where the real engineering work begins.

#### The AI Jobs Crisis - Translator Edition
[AI Killed My Job: Translators - by Brian Merchant](https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/ai-killed-my-job-translators) #ai #jobs #automation 

> To wit: After I put out [the call for AI Killed My Job](https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/did-ai-kill-your-job) stories, I heard from a _lot_ of translators, interpreters, and video game localizers (essentially translators for in-game text, design and dialogue). Of all the groups I heard from, translators had some of the most harrowing, and saddest, stories to share. Their accounts were quite different from [those described by tech workers](https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/how-ai-is-killing-jobs-in-the-tech-f39), who were more likely to lament managements’ overuse of AI, a surfeit of dubious code in digital infrastructure, hasty layoffs, or the prospect of early retirement.

> In an interesting—and rather telling—wrinkle to the AI boom story, many translators noted that generative AI didn’t usher in any revolutionary improvement to already-existing technologies that have been used to automate translation for years. Long before AI became the toast of Silicon Valley, corporate clients had been pushing lower-paying machine translation post-editing (MTPE) jobs[1](https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/ai-killed-my-job-translators#footnote-1-171094084), or editing the output of AI translation systems, though many translators refused to take them. Others said Google Translate had long been able to essentially what ChatGPT does now.
> 
> Yet many describe a dramatic disruption in wages and working conditions over the last two years, coinciding with the rise of OpenAI. Though my sample size is small, these stories fit my thesis that [the](https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/the-ai-jobs-crisis-is-here-now) _[real](https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/the-ai-jobs-crisis-is-here-now)_ [AI jobs crisis](https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/the-ai-jobs-crisis-is-here-now) is that the drumbeat, marketing, and pop culture of "powerful AI” encourages and permits management to replace or degrade jobs they might not otherwise have. More important than the technological change, perhaps, is the change in a social permission structure.
> 
> Not one but two accounts detail how many translators dismissed ChatGPT at first, because they’ve heard companies tout many automation technologies over the years, all with limited impact—only to see the floor drop out now. And it’s not that ChatGPT is light years better than previous systems (lots of post-AI translation editing is still required), it’s just that businesses have been hearing months of hype and pontification about the arrival of AGI and mass automation, which has created the cover necessary to justify slashing rates and accepting “good enough” automation output for video games and media products. Everyone else is doing it, after all.
