#### You're Not Interviewing for the Job. You're Auditioning for the Job Title
[You're Not Interviewing for the Job. You're Auditioning for the Job Title](https://idiallo.com/blog/performing-for-the-job-title)

> I once read that "a complex system usually reflects an absence of good design." It's brilliant. True. And if you're prepping for a system design interview, forget it immediately.
> 
> In real-world engineering, simplicity is king. In interviews, **complexity is currency.**
> 
> Job interviews aren't assessments. They're auditions for a job title: **The Architect Who Solves Hard Problems™.**
> 
> You're not being evaluated on whether you can build the described system efficiently. You're being evaluated on whether you can **perform the role** of someone who could theoretically build Google.


> I'm not advocating dishonesty, I'm acknowledging reality. Interviews are a ritual, and rituals have rules. Here's how to navigate them:
> 
> **Separate Performance from Practice**: Playing the interview game doesn't make you a hypocrite. It makes you pragmatic about a broken system. You can excel at interview theater while still being a principled engineer once you're hired.
> 
> **Learn the Sacred Texts**: Study distributed systems patterns even if you'll never use them. Memorize the CAP theorem even if it's mostly irrelevant to your daily work. Practice drawing architecture diagrams that look impressive on whiteboards. Think of it as learning a foreign language you'll only speak during interviews.
> 
> **Embrace the Tropes**: Always start discussions with "At scale, we'd need to consider..." Mention monitoring and observability early and often, even for simple systems. Add redundancy everywhere, even for non-critical components. Use the magic words that signal competence in interview-land.
> 
> **Then Drop the Act**: Once hired, advocate ruthlessly for simplicity. Be the voice of reason who asks "Do we actually need this complexity?" Use your hard-earned credibility to push back against unnecessary over-engineering. This is where the real engineering work begins.
