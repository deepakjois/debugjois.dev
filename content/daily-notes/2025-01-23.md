#### John Prideaux from The Economist on Trump's Inauguration
[Examining what was said and what was signed on Trump’s day one](https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2025/01/21/examining-what-was-said-and-what-was-signed-on-trumps-day-one) #podcast #trump 

This bit from the podcast transcript stood out for me with references to manifest destiny and the gilded age.

_Clip_ below refers to quotes from Trump as heard on audio.

> **Jason Palmer** [00:03:06] And yet we’ve all been looking forward to the inaugural address as a kind of bellwether for what we’re actually going to get this time around. What was your take?
> 
> **John Prideaux** [00:03:14] The single line that stood out to me most from the speech was about the Panama Canal, which is quite a strange thing to stand out in an inaugural address.
> 
> **Clip** [00:03:23] Violated American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form.
> 
> **John Prideaux** [00:03:34] He said about the Panama Canal. We will take it back.
> 
> **Clip** [00:03:37] And above all, China is operating the Panama Canal. And we didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama and we’re taking it back.
> 
> **John Prideaux** [00:03:49] And that is quite striking coming from an American president. I don’t think Donald Trump means he’s going to send in the 82nd Airborne, as George H.W. Bush did in the late 1980s to Panama to take it back by force. But that was kind of the impression that he got. And it was an impression reinforced in other parts of the speech where he talked about America’s manifest destiny, which is an old 19th century theme in American history about conquering and taming the whole of the continent.
> 
> **Clip** [00:04:22] The United States will once again consider itself a growing nation, one that increases our wealth, expands our territory.
> 
> **John Prideaux** [00:04:32] He talked about Manifest Destiny and said that one of the things that was important to him was that America should always be a growing nation. It should be expanding its territory now like it expanded its territory in the 19th century. Not to the same extent, perhaps, but the idea is the same. That is a very old idea of American greatness. It’s really a throwback to William McKinley, who President Trump mentioned a couple of times favourably.
> 
> **Clip** [00:05:03] President McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent. He was a natural businessman.
> 
> **John Prideaux** [00:05:12] McKinley was president at the end of the 19th century, at a time when America’s territory expanded. He was also extremely keen on tariffs and had backing from a lot of the wealthiest Americans in the Gilded Age. In McKinley’s age, those wealthy entrepreneurs were people like J.P. Morgan and John D Rockefeller. In the Donald Trump the golden Age as he described his new Gilded Age. There were people like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, all of whom were at Trump’s inauguration. There was another striking moment when he talked about going to Mars and planting the American flag on Mars. And at that moment, Elon Musk, whose own goal is to make mankind a multiplanetary species, was delighted and gave a double thumbs up.
> 
> **Clip** [00:05:59] And we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars.

#### The Trump Administration and WHO
[The Trump Administration just walked out on global health](https://news.immunologic.org/p/the-trump-administration-just-walked)

> His decision to withdraw the US from the World Health Organization (WHO) will be catastrophic if it is more than bluster. We all have media fatigue. Wellness disinformation is rampant. But we cannot be complacent. This Executive Order isn’t just another “crazy thing Trump has done” to add to the pile.
> 
> The US leaving the WHO is a moral failing even more than it is a catastrophic policy decision.
> 
> And it reeks of ignorance from people who have not experienced places where the WHO is the difference between life and death for billions of people. It’s cruel and immoral. And it will harm Americans and the rest of the planet.

#### Men and the Beauty Industrial Complex
[My father had plastic surgery. Now he wants me and my mother to get work done | Well actually | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jan/22/men-plastic-surgery) #beauty #feminism 

Jessica DeFino talks about how men are being coopted into the beauty industrial complex

> Girls are born into [beauty culture](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/nov/27/cost-of-beauty-culture-benefits), which teaches us that appearance is a key measure of our worth. It’s communal! Social! _Fun!_ Feminine beauty ideals are modeled by the dolls we play with. (Hi, Barbie.) The rules are passed down in games and stories. (Remember Pretty Pretty Princess?) Products become portals to friendship and connection. We learn to self-surveil and to surveil others, often subconsciously, as a way to gauge our personal success and help our loved ones succeed, too.
> 
> Some of us eventually reckon with this, and realize the urge to embody beauty standards isn’t a harmless hobby so much as a [harmful](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/nov/27/cost-of-beauty-culture-benefits) obligation. But that can take time.
> 
> Your father, freshly exposed to beauty culture in his 50s, isn’t there yet. He still has the mindset of an adolescent. And he’s far from alone!
> 
> The cosmetics industry has been reeling men into its multibillion-dollar empire in recent years. Call it inclusivity: the media hailed singer Joe Jonas’s 2022 endorsement of Xeomin, a Botox alternative, as “[genderless self-care](https://jessicadefino.substack.com/p/joe-jonas-xeomin-botox-injectables)”. Call it capitalism: Pharrell, Machine Gun Kelly, Harry Styles and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson all cashed in on the celebrity beauty brand boom by launching their own lines. Call it contagion: an increasingly virtual world is an increasingly visual world, and the pressure to prioritize aesthetics is reaching parents, children and even [pets](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/aug/05/delicate-authentic-charismatic-dolce-gabbana-launch-perfume-for-dogs).
> 
> Whatever you call it, it’s working.

…

> In an ideal world, cis, straight men’s growing interest in a traditionally female- and queer-focused category might inspire them to question arbitrary gender norms – to free themselves from the trap of toxic masculinity! Alas, that’s not what’s happening.
> 
> Instead, men have recast cosmetics as power tools for alphas, reinforcing sexist stereotypes and promoting ageist, classist, oppressive appearance ideals. Beautification has been rebranded as [“looksmaxxing”](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/feb/15/from-bone-smashing-to-chin-extensions-how-looksmaxxing-is-reshaping-young-mens-faces) and perfume as “[scentmaxxing](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/may/27/teenage-boys-just-want-to-smell-nice-if-only-the-perfume-influencers-didnt-stink)”. Swallowing skincare supplements is referred to as “biohacking” and anti-ageing as “[longevity](https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/sep/13/rich-men-longevity-history)”. Don’t Die: The Man Who Wants To Live Forever, a [new Netflix documentary](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/02/bryan-johnson-documentary-dont-die-netflix) on the 47-year-old tech entrepreneur Bryan Johnson’s obsession with living forever and looking like a teenager, might give you some insight into your dad’s mental state.

and finally she starts off describing an antidote to this:

> To help your dad understand what’s happening to him – and how it’s affecting the women in his life – I suggest what I’d suggest to any [Sephora tween](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/feb/25/sephora-tweens-are-raiding-drunk-elephant-and-we-only-have-ourselves-to-blame) on the cusp of critical thinking: feminism.

Lot of good resources. Love how she can contextualize each them with punchy phrases.

> He needs to grasp that beauty culture is “always actually prescribing behaviour and not appearance”, as Naomi Wolf writes in 1990’s [The Beauty Myth](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&url=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fp%2Fbooks%2Fthe-beauty-myth-how-images-of-beauty-are-used-against-women-naomi-wolf%2F7898731%3Fean%3D9780060512187&sref=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jan/22/men-plastic-surgery).

#### Odd Lots on Crypto Philosophizing
[Nobody is Interested in Your Crypto Philosophizing - Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-22/nobody-is-interested-in-your-crypto-philosophizing)

> If you were to go back 10 years ago and looked at what people in crypto were talking about on Twitter (or on Reddit, or the various message boards) there were a lot of debates going on about the economic tradeoffs in blockchain design.
> 
> Should blockchains be optimized for low fees? Should they be optimized for speed? Will cryptocurrencies ever be used at Starbucks to pay for a coffee? If you are going to pay for coffee using crypto, should that be done directly on the chain, or should it be done on some “Layer 2” solution that resolves on the chain? How should a blockchain go about making upgrades?
> 
> These were genuinely interesting conversations that sat at the intersection of computer science and economics, and even anthropology.
>
> But you don’t really find that so much these days…

…

> There is one crypto project where there still is a lot of talk about blockchain design and governance and non-speculative use cases.

#### Becoming a Polymath vs Becoming an Expert
[Facing My Own Mediocrity - by Brock Covington](https://brockcovington.substack.com/p/facing-my-own-mediocrity)

This in short is the story of my life

> Months ago, I wrote a post on [becoming a polymath](https://brockcovington.substack.com/p/becoming-a-polymath), or in other words, how to diversify your skillset and thrive in various pursuits. In the post, one drawback I expressed is that you’ll likely find yourself in a place of mediocrity or with merely moderate proficiency in a desired field; but this reluctance towards mastery or the pursuit of maximized potential is not unique to polymaths. It’s something I’ve struggled with for years and still reflect on.
> 
> To best describe this predicament, I’ll explain my own personal experience. Ever since adolescence, I’ve rarely been impeded by a lack of motivation or discipline. Whether it’s fitness, business, literature, videography, or language, the audacity to try anything with confidence is seemingly ingrained in my genes. But the ability to start something is only the beginning. What plagues me is the lack of ambition to see a particular skill through to mastery or chase excellence within a field. I reach a respectable or above average status, but I fail to reach expertise. I've become the proverbial ‘jack of all trades, master of none’ and feel plunged into a pit of frustration. Is it better to be an amateur in a hundred fields or a master of one?
> 
> Each new hobby or skill I delve into feels like the twist of an arbor press flattening me further and further until my diversification has rendered me thin and useless. I hear Dostoevsky’s admonition in _Netochka Nezvanova_, _“You're a hundred times greater an artist than I, if only you had my endurance,”_ except I have the endurance, but lack the focus or specialization to achieve the true mark of greatness.

But the last paragraph offers some guidance on how to go about finding a solution

> To me, the complexity that lies in this question is greater than those posed by a lack of motivation of discipline. One is solved by strengthening willpower, while the other requires deep reflection and self-awareness of what one truly desires from their life.

#### The Adaptive Role of Emotions
Living Fossils reposted an older piece, and it was a good recap: [The Adaptive Role of Emotions - by Josh Zlatkus](https://thelivingfossils.substack.com/p/the-adaptive-role-of-emotions) #emotions #evo-psych #evolution 

First some evolution basics:

> Like most species-typical traits, emotions evolved in what evolutionary psychologists call “the environment of evolutionary adaptedness,” or EEA. The EEA is the environment—technically, a statistical composite of environmental conditions—in which humans evolved.[2](https://thelivingfossils.substack.com/p/the-adaptive-role-of-emotions#footnote-2-121569985) It is worth reflecting that humans have only been agricultural for the last 10,000 years (5% our history), industrial for the last 150 years (.075%), and digital for the last 30 years (.015%).[3](https://thelivingfossils.substack.com/p/the-adaptive-role-of-emotions#footnote-3-121569985) These modes of existence are unlikely to have influenced our psychological architecture much because they haven’t been around very long compared to other modes of existence, like hunting and gathering in small tribes.[4](https://thelivingfossils.substack.com/p/the-adaptive-role-of-emotions#footnote-4-121569985)
> 
> Our modern environment is similar in some ways to the EEA (we still breathe oxygen) but different in others (we interact with far more people today). These differences often have unfortunate results, such as when our sweet tooth, designed for a sugar-scarce world, meets ice-cream. Indeed, it may be that eating _too much_ is [now more deadly](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight) than not eating enough. We tend to understand such evolutionary mismatch, I think—at least to the extent we are aware of it—as an inevitable cost to human progress. All else equal, the temptation to eat too much is considered less bad than the possibility of starving.

coming to emotions

> With all this as background, it should be easier to understand why I’m rankled by cognitive behavioral therapy’s use of the word [“maladaptive”](https://beckinstitute.org/blog/the-holistic-model/) to describe client emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. Of course, what CBT means by “maladaptive” is that some emotions, thoughts, and patterns of behavior are inconsistent with a person’s goals. For example, outbursts of anger are not conducive to getting promoted or building friendships. But boy, what a poor word choice for the orientation that holds itself out as the most [“evidence-based,](https://jonathanshedler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Shedler-2018-Where-is-the-evidence-for-evidence-based-therapy.pdf)” when the evidence is quite strong that [emotions are, in fact, adaptations](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/09637214211007451). While CBT should know better, it is not alone. Every therapeutic orientation conceptualizes emotions differently, and I have yet to encounter one that understands them as adaptive in the evolutionary sense.

and finally a call to base therapy on more solid foundations

> At the very least, an _ultimate_ explanation for emotions—as adaptations that helped our ancestors navigate problems and opportunities—could become the common starting point for this central topic in mental health. Rather than allow every therapeutic technique its own origin story, within which emotions are defined anew, let’s actually make therapy a scientific enterprise by building on shared, epistemological bedrock.

#### What Netflix is doing to cinema
[What Netflix Has Done to Movies w/ Will Tavlin - Episodes - Tech Won’t Save Us](https://techwontsave.us/episode/258_what_netflix_has_done_to_movies_w_will_tavlin) #netflix #pop-culture #movies #tv 

Also relevant is this article in n+1 written by the podcast guest: [Casual Viewing \| Issue 49 \| n+1 \| Will Tavlin](https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-49/essays/casual-viewing/)

Summarized this podcast using ChatGPT

**1. Introduction: The Evolution of Netflix and Its Consequences**

- Paris Marx opens by reflecting on Netflix's influence on how we consume film and television.
- Will Tavlin, a writer who recently published an essay in _n+1_, joins to discuss Netflix’s business model and its broader cultural consequences.
- Key topic: Netflix’s trajectory from innovator in the DVD rental and streaming spaces to a dominant yet detrimental force in filmmaking.

**2. Netflix’s Origin Story and Mythmaking**

- **The Netflix Origin Myth**: Co-founder Reed Hastings claimed Netflix emerged after a frustrating $40 late fee from Blockbuster for _Apollo 13_. This story is false but was key to branding Netflix as a customer-focused alternative to Blockbuster.
- **Reality**: Netflix initially rented and sold DVDs online and shifted to its famous subscription model to improve efficiency. This strategy leveraged customer behavior—turning users into “mini-warehouses” by letting them hold DVDs longer, reducing Netflix’s storage and shipping costs.
- **Key quote from Tavlin:** “Netflix rewarded customers for being mindless, while Blockbuster punished them for being forgetful.”

**3. Streaming: From Experiment to Industry Domination**

- Streaming was Hastings’ vision from the start, but technology (internet speeds, infrastructure) only caught up by 2007. Netflix launched its primitive streaming service, WatchNow, with just 1,000 titles.
- Streaming allowed Netflix to collect real-time user data, tracking viewing habits to refine algorithms and programming decisions.
- **Key point:** While Netflix claimed its data drove the creation of hits like _House of Cards_, Tavlin emphasizes that human decision-making still played a significant role in interpreting data.

**4. Netflix’s Expansion: Targeting Television and Film**

- Netflix attacked industries people disliked: first video rentals (Blockbuster), then cable television. Cable companies were notorious for monopolies and poor service, which Netflix disrupted.
- Netflix's entry into original content (_House of Cards_) emphasized binge-watching and abandoning traditional TV formats (e.g., weekly releases). This appealed to viewers but shifted industry norms.
- In the film industry, Netflix initially invested in independent films, acquiring titles at festivals and giving creators global exposure on its platform.

**5. The Disillusionment with Netflix’s Indie Film Push**

- **Early Optimism**: Filmmakers and journalists welcomed Netflix as a potential savior of indie film, providing funding and a global audience.
- **Reality**: Netflix’s model undercut the traditional value of films:
    - Films became trapped on the platform, with limited physical releases and no marketing push.
    - Indie films lacked opportunities for theatrical runs or cultural longevity, as Netflix prioritized its algorithm over traditional distribution.
    - **Key quote:** “Films were effectively lost—not because they didn’t exist, but because they were buried on Netflix’s platform.”

**6. The Rise of the “Typical Netflix Movie”**

- By 2019, Netflix shifted away from indie films toward low-cost, mass-appeal “content.”
- Characteristics of the “Typical Netflix Movie”:
    - Generic titles optimized for search (e.g., _Murder Mystery_).
    - Mediocre production quality with saturated colors and bland visuals.
    - Simple, repetitive dialogue to accommodate viewers multitasking on their phones (“second screen content”).
    - Tavlin compares these films to “screensavers,” designed to be consumed passively in the background.

**7. Netflix’s Deceptive Viewership Metrics**

- Netflix’s data practices are opaque and misleading:
    - Early metrics counted “views” if users watched at least 2 minutes of a title, even if it auto-played.
    - Current metrics divide total viewing hours by runtime to produce “views,” even if viewers don’t finish a film.
    - **Key point:** Netflix’s metrics favor quantity over quality, prioritizing engagement rather than meaningful viewership.
    - **Quote from Tavlin:** “The decision to make crap and garbage is one they justify with data, but they’re choosing to invest in that kind of stuff.”

**8. The Broader Impact on Cinema**

- Netflix has redefined the cultural meaning of movies:
    - Films have shifted from experiences demanding attention (in theaters) to background noise competing for fragmented attention at home.
    - The term “second screen” once referred to live-tweeting TV; now, the phone is the primary screen, and Netflix’s content is the secondary screen.
- Streaming platforms have devalued both the artistry and labor behind filmmaking.
- Tavlin argues that Netflix, despite its initial promise, has contributed to a degradation of cinema as a medium.

**Actionable Takeaways**

1. **Support Theatrical Releases**: Watching films in cinemas helps preserve their cultural and artistic value.
2. **Seek Alternatives**: Explore platforms and distributors prioritizing quality over quantity (e.g., Criterion, Mubi).
3. **Demand Transparency**: Push for better reporting of streaming viewership and fairer compensation for creators.
4. **Be Critical of Streaming Culture**: Recognize how platforms shape what and how we consume media.

**Memorable Quotes**

- “Blockbuster punished customers for being forgetful; Netflix rewarded them for being mindless.”
- “Netflix transformed movies into background noise, designed to exist as second-screen content.”
- “The decision to make garbage isn’t inevitable—it’s a choice.”
