Spent the whole day outside and did fun things!
#### Dot Mandala
Made this dot mandala at [StoryZone](https://www.instagram.com/storyzone.in) and had loads of fun. We were given a 3 min intro with the tools and off we went for two hours just randomly trying out things. I chose to focus on bright colors and simple patterns. Check out the result below.

#### HSR Food
Tried two places in HSR Layout:

- [Gavran Misal](https://gavranmisal.com/p/about-us): This has been around for a while, but I never got around to trying it earlier. Finally tried it today and it was great 👍🏽!
- [Godavari Cafe HSR](https://www.instagram.com/godavari_cafe_): A new place that opened up recently. I believe they are marketing themselves as an Andhra style darshini place with good outdoor seating.
