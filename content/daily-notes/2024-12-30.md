#### dotnet versions
I am playing with .NET on OS X, and here are some notes for posterity.

I can install a specific older version of .NET (for e.g. .NET 6) using the following brew command.

```
brew install dotnet@6
export DOTNET_ROOT="/opt/homebrew/opt/dotnet@6/libexec"
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/dotnet@6/bin:$PATH"
```

However, when I do this I cannot access the latest .NET version which I installed previously using `brew install dotnet`. 

I found this homebrew tap: [GitHub - isen-ng/homebrew-dotnet-sdk-versions: dotnet-sdk versions HomeBrew Tap](https://github.com/isen-ng/homebrew-dotnet-sdk-versions)

The first thing I was doing slightly wrong was that I was installing `dotnet` (the runtime) instead of `dotnet-sdk`.

I realised the correct way to install multiple versions of `dotnet-sdk` is as follows.

```
brew install dotnet-sdk
brew tap isen-ng/dotnet-sdk-versions
brew install --cask dotnet-sdk6
brew install --cask dotnet-sdk7
```

#### vscode C\#
After a bit of trial and error, I figured out that most of what I need for C# development in vscode is available with the C# dev kit extension: [C# Dev Kit - Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit)
