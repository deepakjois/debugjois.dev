#### The Evolution of Psychiatry
[The evolution of psychiatry - by Adam Hunt](https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/the-evolution-of-psychiatry) #evo-psych #evolution #psychology #psychiatry

> Why do psychiatric conditions exist?
> 
> …The framework in question is evolutionary psychiatry, and its principle thinking is simple: if we use evolutionary theory to explain biology, then we should be using evolutionary theory to explain psychiatric disorder. If evolution was given proper attention and integrated into mainstream psychiatry, we would usher in a new era of understanding and treatment of psychiatric conditions.

> Psychiatric therapies have never been atheoretical – psychiatrists have always justified their treatments with some school of thought: Freudian psychodynamic theories placed blame on early childhood and subconscious urges; behaviorism justified the application of pain to try and train people out of wrongthink; and more recently, [chemical imbalance theories](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315533279_Challenging_the_Narrative_of_Chemical_Imbalance_A_Look_at_the_Evidence) were used to advertise pharmaceuticals, despite the narrative of simple dopamine and serotonin dysfunctions having been [long dismissed](https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/debunking-two-chemical-imbalance-myths-again) in academic circles. Recent advances in genetics and neuroscience have provided more evidence and complexity, but no promising new theories. Psychiatry today can be considered [a discipline in crisis](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mind-Fixers-Psychiatrys-Troubled-Biology/dp/0393071227), surviving only because psychological and pharmaceutical treatments are effective for some people, some of the time, and so we still need them. The way is open for a new paradigm in psychiatric theorizing.

> Darwin’s prophecy manifested itself in psychology around 100 years after his writing. Now, evolutionary psychology has become a common reference point for public discussion and academic research. Evolutionary psychiatry is a late follower, arising in the last years of the twentieth century alongside evolutionary medicine, its foundational work owing to Randolph Nesse, George Williams, John Price, and others.

> This unique theoretical strength has been followed up by work in evolutionary medicine and psychiatry identifying [six reasons](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~nesse/Articles/Nesse%20-%202015%20-%20Evolutionary%20Psychology%20and%20Mental%20Health.pdf) why conditions we define as disorder or disease (of body or mind) persist in evolved creatures:
> 
> 1. Constraints on biological design, because evolution can only make alterations within a certain range.
> 2. Pathogens evolve, so we cannot evolve perfect immunity against them.
> 3. Design trade-offs and byproducts make perfection impossible.
> 4. Evolved defenses against disease and danger often induce harmful symptoms.
> 5. Selection is for reproductive success, not health, so we can evolve in ways which are debilitating if they allow us to reproduce more successfully.
> 6. Mismatch between evolved systems and modern environments lead to novel, harmful, reactions.
> 
> Of these six reasons, it’s important to note that the last four are the modern result of functioning rather than dysfunctioning processes. The idea that natural selection would only encourage perfect health is mistaken. It’s entirely possible for evolution to lead our bodies and minds into states which we now diagnose and treat as disorders or diseases.

> For instance, some are mismatched psychological systems which are exposed to over-stimulation in the modern environment, becoming the biggest causes of abuse, ruination and early death in developed countries. [Alcoholism and drug abuse](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23881888/) manipulate natural chemical pathways which exist for evolutionarily advantageous reasons; [obesity](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25749980/) by overeating is caused by natural desires for sweet and fatty foods; and [gambling addiction](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15577272/) is likely linked to a history of continuously searching for scarce high-calorie food and other risky but rewarding endeavors.

This bit on autism is really insightful.

> Investigating the most severely disabled autistic individuals you almost always discover damaging [genetic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4694565/) mutations or early life trauma, such as foetal alcohol syndrome. These are clear cases of biological dysfunction. On the other hand, the less severely disabled individuals (who would once have been called Asperger’s or “high-functioning”) show none of those biological signs of dysfunction, instead showing evidence we expect from functional adaptations: the associated genes are common and complex, brain differences are subtle, the characteristics appear early in life when they are guaranteed to affect reproduction, and the prevalence is high enough that at least one person per [Dunbar-sized](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.2004.2970) hunter-gatherer social group of one hundred and fifty would show the same traits – in which case, every one of our ancestors would have known an autistic person. These biological signs are those we expect to see from adaptations, not dysfunction. The question we are led to ask is what autism’s function could have been.
> 
> Psychologically, autistics often show unusual [abilities](https://europepmc.org/article/med/25374134) in intelligence, memory, and perception, especially in their areas of special interest or obsession. An anthropologist once stumbled upon a reindeer herder in Siberia who camped alone, ate alone and chose to keep away from the rest of their small nomadic group, but who could list the names, medical history, parentage and more of a group of 2,600 reindeer. [Researchers](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1751696X.2016.1244949) have identified this as a possible case of an autistic mind playing a crucial role in a group’s survival. Technologies which played crucial roles in human civilization’s birth such as oil lamps, multi-component tools, star maps, grinding stones and fire hearths have also all been suggested as the sorts of things which autistic people gravitate towards. Social oddities could be forgiven when your mind is spectacularly useful, so this ability profile explains why these cases of autism evolved. Autistic minds sacrificed social nuance as trade-offs in becoming the object and system specialists amongst our hunter-gatherer ancestors. Those same individuals can [excel](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01N2W270Y/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) in technological and scientific endeavors in the modern world.

“the alteration of stigma”

> Theoretical clarity does not necessarily make for treatment improvements, but one way in which explanations from evolutionary psychiatry could instantly improve lives, essentially free of financial cost, is through the alteration of stigma. The causal explanation of a disorder affects its stigmatization. People believing [chemical imbalance theories](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24657311) of depression feel more hopeless when diagnosed as depressed; people believing in [genetic and neurological causes](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26805779/) of psychosis are more stigmatizing of psychotic individuals than people who believe psychosis results from stress. In turn, an evolutionary explanation of a disorder inevitably changes that disorder’s perception. The full effects of this shift in perception are yet to be seen, and will of course depend on the condition and specific explanation. Psychopathy, for example, may not be destigmatized by an explanation as a cheating strategy which is game theoretically optimal for some portion of a group.

#### René Girard's influence on the US far right

on memetic desire

> Girard is best known for his theory of “mimetic desire”, the idea that humans don’t desire things in and of themselves, but out of a wish to imitate and compete with others. On the back of this insight, the writer built a distinctive anthropology, borrowing from and contest-ing the theories of Nietzsche and Freud. He also came up with a set of ideas about scapegoating that have been taken up by rightwing readers in recent years in their critiques of so-called cancel culture. While Girard described himself as a centrist, his ideas are now celebrated by a movement that, while not unilaterally rightwing, incubated the policies of the Trump administration.

> The idea is set out in Girard’s first book, Deceit, Desire and the Novel (published in French in 1961), which describes how Don Quixote, Madame Bovary and characters from Stendhal, Proust and Dostoyevsky come to desire things because others already want them. “Man is the creature who does not know what to desire, and he turns to others in order to make up his mind,” he wrote. The fact that desires are borrowed means they are necessarily competitive. If you desire your neighbour’s husband, you have to contend with your neighbour in order to get what you want — or what you think you want. Mimetic desire leads to fruitless competition, unhappiness and even violence.

Girard’s early work was informed by “structuralism” — the study of language and society as a closed system of interrelated signs, which was then dominant in French universities. But he was present at the birth of a new movement. In 1966, Johns Hopkins hosted a conference devoted to structuralism with the unprepossessing title, “The Languages of Criticism and the Sciences of Man”, that didn’t hint at the controversy it would cause. Girard and his colleagues invited a group of pre-eminent French thinkers, including the philosopher Michel Foucault, psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan and anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss to attend. It was the last speaker to be invited who proved the most disruptive. After Lévi-Strauss and Foucault dropped out, Girard extended an invitation to a young Algerian-born philosopher, still little known in France: Jacques Derrida. In the final paper of the conference, Derrida attacked the basic assumptions of structuralism. This was the point of departure for his philosophical method, deconstruction, which sought to undo binary distinctions — raw/cooked, light/dark, sane/insane etc — in order to reveal the social forces that upheld them. Some conservatives today consider Derrida’s thought (or “postmodernism”, as they usually call it) to be the source of modern society’s ills. Girard later joked that, by inviting Derrida, he and his fellow conference organisers had let the plague into America.
