#### The Evolution of Psychiatry
[The evolution of psychiatry - by Adam Hunt](https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/the-evolution-of-psychiatry) #evo-psych #evolution #psychology #psychiatry

> Why do psychiatric conditions exist?
> 
> …The framework in question is evolutionary psychiatry, and its principle thinking is simple: if we use evolutionary theory to explain biology, then we should be using evolutionary theory to explain psychiatric disorder. If evolution was given proper attention and integrated into mainstream psychiatry, we would usher in a new era of understanding and treatment of psychiatric conditions.

> Psychiatric therapies have never been atheoretical – psychiatrists have always justified their treatments with some school of thought: Freudian psychodynamic theories placed blame on early childhood and subconscious urges; behaviorism justified the application of pain to try and train people out of wrongthink; and more recently, [chemical imbalance theories](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315533279_Challenging_the_Narrative_of_Chemical_Imbalance_A_Look_at_the_Evidence) were used to advertise pharmaceuticals, despite the narrative of simple dopamine and serotonin dysfunctions having been [long dismissed](https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/debunking-two-chemical-imbalance-myths-again) in academic circles. Recent advances in genetics and neuroscience have provided more evidence and complexity, but no promising new theories. Psychiatry today can be considered [a discipline in crisis](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mind-Fixers-Psychiatrys-Troubled-Biology/dp/0393071227), surviving only because psychological and pharmaceutical treatments are effective for some people, some of the time, and so we still need them. The way is open for a new paradigm in psychiatric theorizing.

> Darwin’s prophecy manifested itself in psychology around 100 years after his writing. Now, evolutionary psychology has become a common reference point for public discussion and academic research. Evolutionary psychiatry is a late follower, arising in the last years of the twentieth century alongside evolutionary medicine, its foundational work owing to Randolph Nesse, George Williams, John Price, and others.

This unique theoretical strength has been followed up by work in evolutionary medicine and psychiatry identifying [six reasons](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~nesse/Articles/Nesse%20-%202015%20-%20Evolutionary%20Psychology%20and%20Mental%20Health.pdf) why conditions we define as disorder or disease (of body or mind) persist in evolved creatures:

1. Constraints on biological design, because evolution can only make alterations within a certain range.
    
2. Pathogens evolve, so we cannot evolve perfect immunity against them.
    
3. Design trade-offs and byproducts make perfection impossible.
    
4. Evolved defenses against disease and danger often induce harmful symptoms.
    
5. Selection is for reproductive success, not health, so we can evolve in ways which are debilitating if they allow us to reproduce more successfully.
    
6. Mismatch between evolved systems and modern environments lead to novel, harmful, reactions.

Of these six reasons, it’s important to note that the last four are the modern result of functioning rather than dysfunctioning processes. The idea that natural selection would only encourage perfect health is mistaken. It’s entirely possible for evolution to lead our bodies and minds into states which we now diagnose and treat as disorders or diseases.
