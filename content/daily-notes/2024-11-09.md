### 2024-11-09
Turns out it took me longer to actually feel fully recovered despite the fever receding earlier this week. Decided to take a break from daily logging. But now I am back!

#### Podcast Recap
- A couple of podcasts from the backlog, in the Evolving Psychiatry series:
	- [Alcohol and Evolution | Robin Dunbar | Evolving Psychiatry Podcast #13 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9fqVmR_YiI) - Lots of cool insights in this podcast about alcoholism. If there is one key takeaway, it is that primates (and subsequently humans) evolved the ability to metabolize alcohol because it allowed them to eat rotten (i.e. fermented) fruit off the forest floor without dying.
	- [Evolution, Autism and ADHD | Annie Swanepoel | Evolving Psychiatry Podcast #15 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHbKSX75iOo) #mentalhealth #evo-psych 
- [Why ADHD is just a different way of being normal](https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2024/11/06/why-adhd-is-just-a-different-way-of-being-normal) - The title says it all. This is a more accessible podcast than the ones above.
- [Writing a shell in Go with Qi Xiao (Go Time #336)](https://changelog.com/gotime/336) - Good discussion of shells, terminal and Go. #golang #shell
- [Our critics’ best advice for how to discover new music | FT Weekend Podcast](https://www.ft.com/content/1ddb02f1-5ffd-46d8-9f80-6543015db071)
- [AI’s destroying seasonal content - Power User with Taylor Lorenz ](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/power-user-with/ais-destroying-seasonal-loyBCspa372/)
