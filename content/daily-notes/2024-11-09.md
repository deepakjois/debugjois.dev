Turns out it took me longer to actually feel fully recovered despite the fever receding earlier this week. Decided to take a break from daily logging. But now I am back!

#### Podcast Recap
- A couple of podcasts from the backlog, in the Evolving Psychiatry series:
	- [Alcohol and Evolution | Robin Dunbar | Evolving Psychiatry Podcast #13 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9fqVmR_YiI) - Lots of cool insights in this podcast about alcoholism. If there is one key takeaway, it is that primates (and subsequently humans) evolved the ability to metabolize alcohol because it allowed them to eat rotten (i.e. fermented) fruit off the forest floor without dying.
	- [Evolution, Autism and ADHD | Annie Swanepoel | Evolving Psychiatry Podcast #15 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHbKSX75iOo)
