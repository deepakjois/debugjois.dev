### 2024-10-30
Another day of fever ðŸ¤’. Subjectively, I feel much better. But the temperature on the thermometer keeps swinging between 99 and 97. FML.

#### Jasmine Green Tea w/ Himalayan Pink Salt
Since I couldn't taste anything with the fever, I decided to try some jasmine green tea with himalayan salt. It's actually quite nice!

#### Special Ops: Lioness
I don't believe this show went mainstream, but it had good reviews in the first season. I loved the action, the drama, the defence/espionage mumbo jumbo and Zoe Saldana in a badass avatar. The second season just released and I watched the first couple of episodes. #tv

#### Call Me Bae
I normally ignore TV shows coming from the Bollywood mafia because it's usually the same old cliched shit. This was why I was sleeping on Call Me Bae. But as I started watching, I actually got into it and binged the entire thing. It has its limitations and awkward moments, but overall it was executed quite well. Very bingeable. Ananya Pandey may not be a top actress, but she is a very underrated one for sure. #tv #india
