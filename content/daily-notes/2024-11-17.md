#### Podcast Recap
- [Live from Bali: How tourists, influencers, and nomads transform destinations (for good and for bad) – Rolf Potts](https://rolfpotts.com/podcast/how-tourists-transform-destinations/) - Nice interview with somebody who gives a sort of insider-outsider perspective on Bali from somebody who is an expat living in Bali, but being mindful of the overtourism and how it effects the local culture, society and ecology.
- [Are run clubs like rehab for the chronically online? Daybreak joined one to find out](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/daybreak/are-run-clubs-like-rehab-for-ySR1kQ-Z8Cc/) - some great on the ground reporting about run clubs in Bengaluru. Ignore the part where some founder dude is spouting high falutin bullshit about "ChatGPT and Productivity" and "The Cultural Pendulum", rest all is good.
- [Gwern Branwen - How an Anonymous Researcher Predicted AI's Trajectory](https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/gwern-branwen) - Gwern is a writer I have enjoyed reading a lot. The podcast goes behind the scenes where Gwern gives an account of what got him into writing and researching. He also goes behind the scenes on his methodology and beliefs. Lots of good takeaways.
- [Adam Tooze: Why Are Poor Americans Voting for the Party of the Rich?](https://foreignpolicy.com/podcasts/ones-and-tooze/why-are-poor-americans-voting-for-the-party-of-the-rich/) - From my initial impressions, this was some fresh analysis of the election from a materialist and class perspective. I plan to read the transcript and extract some quotes from it soon.
- [Secrets of happiness: the happiness hacks backed up by science – podcast | Psychology | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2024/nov/14/secrets-of-happiness-the-happiness-hacks-backed-up-by-science-podcast) - Debunks a bunch of claims about the things that make us happy, for which there is no real scientific evidence. It is careful to point out there may be many things that one can do increase happiness, and they might actually work, but the podcast is more interested in the scientific evidence currently available behind the claims.
	- ['Say Nothing' is a valiant effort at adapting a complex history : Pop Culture Happy Hour : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/14/1212866787/say-nothing-is-a-valiant-effort-at-adapting-a-complex-history) - Started watching this show. This review is a bit mixed, but it just about recommends the show enough for me to persist watching this show. Let's see if I can actually finish.
