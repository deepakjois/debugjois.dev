#### AI and the Humanities
[Will the Humanities Survive Artificial Intelligence? | The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-weekend-essay/will-the-humanities-survive-artificial-intelligence) #ai #humanities

> But factory-style scholarly productivity was never the essence of the humanities. The real project was always us: the work of understanding, and not the accumulation of facts. Not “knowledge,” in the sense of yet another sandwich of true statements about the world. That stuff is great—and where science and engineering are concerned it’s pretty much the whole point. But no amount of peer-reviewed scholarship, no data set, can resolve the central questions that confront every human being: How to live? What to do? How to face death?
> 
> The answers to those questions aren’t out there in the world, waiting to be discovered. They aren’t resolved by “knowledge production.” They are the work of _being_, not _knowing_—and knowing alone is utterly unequal to the task.
> 
> For the past seventy years or so, the university humanities have largely lost sight of this core truth. Seduced by the rising prestige of the sciences—on campus and in the culture—humanists reshaped their work to mimic scientific inquiry. We have produced abundant knowledge about texts and artifacts, but in doing so mostly abandoned the deeper questions of being which give such work its meaning.
> 
> Now everything must change. That kind of knowledge production has, in effect, been _automated_. As a result, the “scientistic” humanities—the production of fact-based knowledge _about_ humanistic things—are rapidly being absorbed by the very sciences that created the A.I. systems now doing the work. We’ll go to them for the “answers.”
> 
> **But to be human is not to have answers. It is to have _questions_—and to live with them. The machines can’t do that for us. Not now, not ever.**

#### The 80-hour myth

The usual productivity spiel but I thought this section was interesting

> **Work Like A Lion, Not A Cow**
> 
> There are two approaches to work.
> 
> First, is like a cow who grazes the fields:
> 
> - Consistent long hours every day
> - Steady and predictable output
> - Trading time for money in a linear fashion
> - Showing up regularly regardless of energy
> - Often leads to burnout and diminishing returns
> 
> Second, is like a lion, which we share a similar psychological wiring in that we are _hunters_ (at least when it comes to work)_._
> 
> Our brain craves the novelty and dopamine that comes along with discovering resources (like ideas) that aid in our survival:
> 
> - Intense bursts of focused, high-energy work
> - Long periods of rest and recovery between hunts
> - Work according to energy and creativity cycles
> - Prioritize impact over number of hours logged
> - Aim for leverage where results aren’t tied to _time_
> 
> A lion, by today’s perception, is a massive procrastinator, and people discourage that. They make you feel guilty for taking your time. They tell you that you lack discipline and you should take things more seriously.
> 
> If you’re bad at texting people back, or you tend to put your work (or homework) off until the last second, it’s not a character flaw, it’s how many people are wired.
> 
> If that sounds like you, what you need to understand is that intensity is better than duration, rest is the most productive form of work, and results matter more than hours.
> 
> But there are a few moving pieces here.
> 
> First, is leveraging your unique strengths that give you an asymmetric advantage.
> 
> Second, is choosing to pursue work that allows you to put lifestyle first.
> 
> That way, you can work according to your energy cycles _and_ make a conscious choice as to what you should be working on. Some creatives worked late into the night while others preferred the morning.
> 
> If someone tells you what to work on, you can’t really change that, and your first priority must be to leave that work.

#### The Seven-Year Rule
[The Seven-Year Rule - MacSparky](https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2025/04/the-seven-year-rule/)

> Years ago, I encountered a fascinating concept in a book by the Dalai Lama: every seven years, human beings transform into entirely new versions of themselves. This idea stems from the biological principle that our bodies replace virtually all their cells over a seven-year cycle. The person you are today doesn’t share a single cell with the version of you from seven years ago. (This is, of course, a generalization as some cells regenerate much faster and others a little slower.)
> 
> There’s something profoundly liberating about this constant state of transformation. We often become fixated on our past: mistakes we’ve made, opportunities we’ve missed, harms inflicted upon us (and by us), or wounds we’ve suffered. But what if we truly internalized that the person who experienced those things no longer exists in a physical sense?
> 
> I recently spoke with a friend who was still dwelling on something that happened thirty years ago. “Why do you care?” I asked him. “That was four versions of you ago. That person doesn’t exist anymore. Move on.”
> 
> This perspective applies equally to our future selves. The version of you that will exist seven years from now hasn’t formed yet. So why not focus your energy and attention on the present moment?
> 
> As you read these words, you are uniquely yourself, different from who you were a moment ago and who you’ll become in the next. By embracing this present version of yourself, you release yourself from the bonds of history while simultaneously doing the greatest possible favor to your future self.
> 
> We exist in a perpetual state of transformation: cellular, psychological, and spiritual. When we recognize and honor this constant evolution, we free ourselves to live more fully in the eternal now. Adopt the Seven-Year Rule. You’ll be doing yourself a favor.

There is too much workout/lifting content out there. But this one caught my eye because
