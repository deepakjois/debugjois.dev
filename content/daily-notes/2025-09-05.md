#### LLMs are slot machines

> Glyph proposes that many LLM-assisted programmers who speak highly of the reliability and value of AI tools are falling prey to two cognitive biases:
> 
> 1. The "availability heuristic" (striking things are easier to remember, which is why we remember the very rare instances of kids being kidnapped and killed, but rarely think about the relatively common phenomenon of kids dying in boring car-crashes); and
>     
> 2. The "salience heuristic" (_big_ things are easier to remember, which is why we double-check that the oven is turned off and the smoke alarms are working after our neighbor's house burns down).
>     
> 
> In the case of LLM coding assistants, this manifests as an unconscious overestimation of how often the LLM saves you time. That's because a coding program that produces a bug that you have to "futz with" for a while before it starts working is normal, and thus unmemorable, while a coding tool that turns a plain-language prompt into a working computer program is _amazing_, so it stands out in your memory.

> But that's not the only way in which an LLM coding assistant is like a slot machine. Reg Braithwaite proposed that AI companies' business model is also like a casino's, because they charge every time you re-prompt the AI. He writes:
> 
> > When you are paying by the "pull of the handle," the vendor's incentive is not to solve your problem with a single pull, but to give the appearance of progress towards solving your problem.

> But there's an important difference between an intern and an LLM. For a senior coder, helping an intern is an investment in nurturing a new generation of talented colleagues. For a reverse-centaur, refining an LLM is either an investment in fixing bugs in a product designed to put you on the breadline (if you believe AI companies' claims that their products will continue to improve until they don't need close supervision), or it's a wasted investment in a "dense intern" who is incapable of improving.

> In this new degraded world, we will see these six behavior patterns from everybody, even (or especially) those who under other circumstances would be well integrated into their communities:
> 
> - **Skepticism:** If events can’t be validated, I can’t give credence to anything.
> - **Aloofness:** If everything gets called into question, I have no basis for shared communal actions.
> - **Silence:** If discussion no longer resolves anything, I have no purpose in speaking.
> - **Indifference:** As I lose connection with people and events, I lose interest in them.
> - **Distrust:** In a world without shared reality, no expert or institution can earn my total trust.
> - **Hostility:** As these traditional connections break down, it doesn’t take much to set off conflicts and violence.


#### Lithuania and The Digital Euro
[In Lithuania, the Digital Euro Is No Longer Theory — It’s Infrastructure](https://www.bigtechnology.com/p/in-lithuania-the-digital-euro-is)

> According to data from the Bank of Lithuania, the country is almost entirely dependent on international card schemes for everyday payments. Neither Lithuania nor 13 other eurozone countries currently have a domestic card system — a dependency that European officials describe as a strategic vulnerability.
> 
> In 2022, the EU paid an estimated €1 billion in card fees to U.S. providers. Lithuania alone handles nearly all of its digital transactions through Visa, Mastercard, Apple Pay, and Google Pay.
> 
> “That kind of reliance on external infrastructure isn’t sustainable,” Lasmanis says. “Especially when you consider that geopolitics now includes cables, chips, and payments.”

The goal is not to eliminate cash, but to create a parallel, digital means of payment: one that is free to use, widely accepted across the eurozone, and capable of functioning even during internet outages or political instability.

Key features include:

- Offline payments, even without mobile or data signal
- Free basic services for individuals, including transfers and point-of-sale payments 
- No commercial data harvesting, with strong privacy guarantees
- Programmable capabilities for governments (like automatic tax refunds or disaster relief)

The plan, currently in the preparatory phase, is to roll out basic infrastructure by 2027, with a full rollout by 2030. The ECB emphasizes that it has no commercial interest in transaction data and that privacy will be “as close to cash as possible,” particularly for offline transactions.

“It’s designed to be neutral and foundational,” says Christine Lagarde, ECB President, in a recent speech. “A public option for digital money.”
