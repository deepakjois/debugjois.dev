#### LLMs are slot machines
[Pluralistic: LLMs are slot-machines (16 Aug 2025) – Pluralistic: Daily links from Cory Doctorow](https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/16/jackpot/) #llms #ai #coding 

> Glyph proposes that many LLM-assisted programmers who speak highly of the reliability and value of AI tools are falling prey to two cognitive biases:
> 
> 1. The "availability heuristic" (striking things are easier to remember, which is why we remember the very rare instances of kids being kidnapped and killed, but rarely think about the relatively common phenomenon of kids dying in boring car-crashes); and
>     
> 2. The "salience heuristic" (_big_ things are easier to remember, which is why we double-check that the oven is turned off and the smoke alarms are working after our neighbor's house burns down).
>     
> 
> In the case of LLM coding assistants, this manifests as an unconscious overestimation of how often the LLM saves you time. That's because a coding program that produces a bug that you have to "futz with" for a while before it starts working is normal, and thus unmemorable, while a coding tool that turns a plain-language prompt into a working computer program is _amazing_, so it stands out in your memory.

> But that's not the only way in which an LLM coding assistant is like a slot machine. Reg Braithwaite proposed that AI companies' business model is also like a casino's, because they charge every time you re-prompt the AI. He writes:
> 
> > When you are paying by the "pull of the handle," the vendor's incentive is not to solve your problem with a single pull, but to give the appearance of progress towards solving your problem.

> But there's an important difference between an intern and an LLM. For a senior coder, helping an intern is an investment in nurturing a new generation of talented colleagues. For a reverse-centaur, refining an LLM is either an investment in fixing bugs in a product designed to put you on the breadline (if you believe AI companies' claims that their products will continue to improve until they don't need close supervision), or it's a wasted investment in a "dense intern" who is incapable of improving.

> In this new degraded world, we will see these six behavior patterns from everybody, even (or especially) those who under other circumstances would be well integrated into their communities:
> 
> - **Skepticism:** If events can’t be validated, I can’t give credence to anything.
> - **Aloofness:** If everything gets called into question, I have no basis for shared communal actions.
> - **Silence:** If discussion no longer resolves anything, I have no purpose in speaking.
> - **Indifference:** As I lose connection with people and events, I lose interest in them.
> - **Distrust:** In a world without shared reality, no expert or institution can earn my total trust.
> - **Hostility:** As these traditional connections break down, it doesn’t take much to set off conflicts and violence.


#### Lithuania and The Digital Euro
[In Lithuania, the Digital Euro Is No Longer Theory — It’s Infrastructure](https://www.bigtechnology.com/p/in-lithuania-the-digital-euro-is)

> According to data from the Bank of Lithuania, the country is almost entirely dependent on international card schemes for everyday payments. Neither Lithuania nor 13 other eurozone countries currently have a domestic card system — a dependency that European officials describe as a strategic vulnerability.
> 
> In 2022, the EU paid an estimated €1 billion in card fees to U.S. providers. Lithuania alone handles nearly all of its digital transactions through Visa, Mastercard, Apple Pay, and Google Pay.
> 
> “That kind of reliance on external infrastructure isn’t sustainable,” Lasmanis says. “Especially when you consider that geopolitics now includes cables, chips, and payments.”



> The goal is not to eliminate cash, but to create a parallel, digital means of payment: one that is free to use, widely accepted across the eurozone, and capable of functioning even during internet outages or political instability.
> 
> Key features include:
> 
> - Offline payments, even without mobile or data signal
> - Free basic services for individuals, including transfers and point-of-sale payments 
> - No commercial data harvesting, with strong privacy guarantees
> - Programmable capabilities for governments (like automatic tax refunds or disaster relief)
> 
> The plan, currently in the preparatory phase, is to roll out basic infrastructure by 2027, with a full rollout by 2030. The ECB emphasizes that it has no commercial interest in transaction data and that privacy will be “as close to cash as possible,” particularly for offline transactions.

> “It’s designed to be neutral and foundational,” says Christine Lagarde, ECB President, in a recent speech. “A public option for digital money.”

#### The evils of social media

> The important thing to remember about “engagement” is that it started out as a metric for “attention” but has since become the target. Now people make ragebait and clickbait just to generate engagement to go viral, giving us all content we would rather not see. This is an inherent problem of social media that didn’t exist on TV, and affects our cultural conversations at large.

> I feel like echo chambers have been talked about _ad nauseam_, but the fragmentation of content consumption is probably an equal threat to our collective well-being. People have come to expect tailor-made videos on their “For You Pages,” creating a more individualistic culture where everybody wants to be the “main character,” and reducing our sense of community with one another.

> Today, social media makes those decisions for you; the implication is that the algorithm already knows what you want to see. Even when it seems like you _do_ have choices, like with long-form content on YouTube and Netflix, the choices that are presented are algorithmically predetermined. The simple difference of not being able to choose what channels you’re watching means you’re playing a less active role in shaping your own identity.

> The instant access and connectivity completely changes our interaction with the medium, engendering a greater sense of immediacy and further blurring the line between media and reality.
> 
> …
> 
> The phone is the culmination of the other dangers—it’s simultaneously designed to be engaging, and personalized, and remove agency. It makes sense that social media as a whole mirrors these attributes.

#### Online Disinhibition Effect
[Insulation Makes Artists and Assholes - by Josh Zlatkus](https://thelivingfossils.substack.com/p/insulation-makes-artists-and-assholes)

> Taken together, these protections make digital life a textbook case of evolutionary mismatch. Humans evolved in small groups where every word and action carried physical, emotional, social, and reputational consequences. When those consequences are diluted, distorted, delayed, or erased online, people unsurprisingly act like jerks. Psychologists even have a name for it: the [Online Disinhibition Effect](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8451443_The_Online_Disinhibition_Effect).


> Well, the distortion—or downright absence—of social feedback from online environments creates something of an incubator for behavior that would not be viable in the face-to-face settings humans lived in until very recently. This is why I was not surprised that Musk might have become his Twitter personality: having successfully product-tested a new personality online, he felt comfortable bringing it into the real world. Twitter gave him the chance to try out a side of himself that may not have gotten off the ground otherwise. The same has been true for millions of people on thousands of platforms worldwide.
