#### Twins in our Primate Past
[Were Twins the Norm in Our Primate Past? – SAPIENS](https://www.sapiens.org/biology/twins-primates-human-evolution/) #twins #evolution 

> Our recent research suggests that [twins were actually the norm](https://doi.org/10.3390/humans4030014) rather than an unusual occurrence worthy of note much further back in primate evolution. Despite the fact that almost all primates today, including people, usually give birth to just one baby, our most recent common ancestor, which roamed North America about [60 million years ago](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000494), likely gave birth to twins as the standard.

> Modern humans overwhelmingly birth just a single child—a rather large child with an even larger head. [Human brain and body size](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1201895109) is certainly connected to our ability to create and refine technologies. Paleoanthropologists have long been investigating what they call [encephalization](https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-53860-4.00019-2): an increase in brain size relative to body size over evolutionary time.

> For primates, and especially humans, [childhood learning is crucial](https://doi.org/10.1002/\(SICI\)1096-8644\(1997\)25+%3C63::AID-AJPA3%3E3.0.CO;2-8). We propose that the switch from twins to singletons was critical for the evolution of large human babies with large brains who were capable of complex learning as infants and young children.

> Based on mathematical modeling, the switch to singletons occurred early on, at least 50 million years ago. From there, many primate lineages, including ours, evolved to have increasingly larger bodies and brains.
