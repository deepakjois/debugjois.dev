#### The Lonely Hunter
I heard these lines in a books podcast this morning and have been thinking about it ever since.

> Deep in the heart of Summer, sweet is life to
>	me still,
> But my heart is a lonely hunter that hunts on
>	a lonely hill.

[The Lonely Hunter by William Sharp - Famous poems, famous poets. - All Poetry](https://allpoetry.com/poem/13210957-The-Lonely-Hunter-by-William-Sharp) #poems #loneliness #grief

> 	This poem explores themes of longing, grief, and the search for connection. The speaker, a solitary figure, yearns for a lost love, represented by a white flower. They wander through a verdant landscape, haunted by memories and the hope of reunion.

Ghostty released today: [Ghostty 1.0 | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42517447) #terminals

I already have it as my terminal with the following minimal config:

```
theme = GruvboxDarkHard
macos-titlebar-style = hidden
window-decoration = false
```

Ghostty is revolutionary in many ways, but I found this article about its native platfrom integration particularly compelling: [Ghostty Is Nativeâ€”So What? | g.p. anders](https://gpanders.com/blog/ghostty-is-native-so-what/)
