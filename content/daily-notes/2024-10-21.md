#### Fullscreen Screenshots on Windows
I watch a lot of video content on my TV that is hooked up to a Windows PC. I wanted a smooth workflow to take fullscreen screenshots with a hotkey while I was watching, without any dialogs or popups.

The Logitech K400 wireless keyboard that I  to use with the PC  does not have a dedicated PrtScrn key. The standard shortcut key `Win` + `Shift` + `S` opened up the Snipping tool which was too disruptive and clunky.

Finally, I download and Installed [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/) and setup the Hotkey for fullscreen capture to be: `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `Backspace`. By default, the screenshots are automatically saved in a folder under `Documents/ShareX`. I  use the hotkey to snap screenshots while watching shows and movies, and they get saved in the background without interruption. I can browse them later and create memes ðŸ˜€! #screenshots #windows
