Facts: [Software Engineer Titles Have (Almost) Lost All Their Meaning](https://www.trevorlasn.com/blog/software-engineer-titles-have-almost-lost-all-their-meaning) #titles #engineering #swe

#### Fullscreen Screenshots on Windows
I watch a lot of video content on my TV that is hooked up to a Windows PC. I wanted a smooth workflow to take fullscreen screenshots with a hotkey while I was watching, without any dialogs or popups.

The Logitech K400 wireless keyboard that I  to use with the PC  does not have a dedicated PrtScrn key. The standard shortcut key `Win` + `Shift` + `S` opened up the Snipping tool which was too disruptive and clunky.

Finally, I download and Installed [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/) and setup the Hotkey for fullscreen capture to be: `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `Backspace`. By default, the screenshots are automatically saved in a folder under `Documents/ShareX`. I  use the hotkey to snap screenshots while watching shows and movies, and they get saved in the background without interruption. I can browse them later and create memes 😀! #screenshots #windows

#### A Philosophy of Travel
Some great tips on travel, and how to travel well: [A Philosophy of Travel - by Tracy Gustilo - Pose Ponder](https://www.pondercraft.com/p/a-philosophy-of-travel)

> I read up on history, geography, and culture. I love to browse street markets and bookstores. If I do touristy things, I prefer secondary or tertiary sites, or locations that domestic travelers themselves go. I travel to learn — and I want to learn to travel _well_. I have no real desire to collect “experiences” of places — just say No to bucket lists! My goal is to stretch to accommodate what’s around me, and to try hard to _see_ _beyond_ whatever’s become habitual and mundane at home.
