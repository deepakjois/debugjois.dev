#### The Cult of Doing Business
[The Cult of Doing Business | Commonwealth Magazine](https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/calvert-work-entrepreneur-ethic-baker-review-job) #business #entrepreneurship #cult

> One of the strangest features of American work culture is the constant pressure to treat one’s job as something more than a job: a calling, a means of expressing oneself, a vehicle for personal growth. This pressure comes from bosses, of course, who would rather foster intrinsic motivation than pay higher wages. But it also comes from popular psychology. As every self-help reader knows, the most successful careerists leverage their own unique personalities to achieve results and add value. They work for themselves. They love what they do. They are radiant with a higher purpose. In a word, they are “entrepreneurial.”
> 
> In his new book, [_Make Your Own Job: How the Entrepreneurial Work Ethic Exhausted America_](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674293601), historian Erik Baker calls this self-help ideology “the rot festering at the core” of our national obsession with work. A comprehensive and sharply written intellectual history, the book traces the origins of several reputedly twenty-first-century maladies to an earlier age. Gig work, as it turns out, didn’t begin with Uber but with Avon direct-sales reps. The wacky metaphysics of today’s tech billionaires have their analogues in the “mind-cures” of nineteenth-century spiritualists. And the celebration of “charismatic” executives has its origins in German social science, with disturbingly fascist undertones. Baker also demonstrates how a fetish for entrepreneurs shaped both modernization theory during the Cold War and now-discredited market-based solutions to global poverty, especially microfinance. But the “marriage of positive psychology and the entrepreneurial ethic” is the book’s primary target. It’s a rotten worldview because it “enjoins us to work more intensely than we need to,” and more importantly, it “leaves us feeling devoid of purpose when we don’t have work.”

> In the fifties, Norman Vincent Peale, a preacher, New Thought evangelist, and eventual officiant of Donald Trump’s first wedding, produced one of the most popular self-help books of all time, _The Power of Positive Thinking_. “The more you lose yourself in something bigger than yourself,” Peale writes, “the more energy you will have.” Strangely, for Peale, that “something bigger” didn’t include unions or the social infrastructure built by Roosevelt’s New Deal, which he fumed against at every turn. The book has never been out of print, and Baker is good at explaining why. For people afraid of falling behind in the wake of the Great Depression (or, in our own time, the Great Recession) the entrepreneurial ethic that arose from New Thought literature “functioned as a sort of insurance policy—not just a failsafe strategy in case of unemployment, but a preemptive ward against redundancy and obsolescence.”

> Just as Dale Carnegie was right to say that people love to hear the sound of their own name, it is probably true that “autoletic” workers (those who discover intrinsic motivation and achieve “flow”) will feel more satisfied at work. But Baker is calling attention to the fact that these ideas become popular among managers for ignoble reasons: they make it cheaper and easier to burden employees with the task of preserving their own well-being. “Autoletic” workers are more easily exploited, as are those who treat their jobs as extension of themselves. The basic career advice one gets from positive psychology is that throwing yourself into your work is the best way to achieve success and personal fulfillment. And since Americans, as Baker suggests, “prize psychological health as highly as a religious duty,” to fail to be entrepreneurial is a kind of mortal sin.

> The Christian language of “duty” and “calling” comes from Max Weber, the German sociologist who studied the problem of how to encourage _Arbeitsfreude_, or “joy in work.” Weber’s 1904 visit to the United States helped convince him of his famous thesis that the main driver of worker motivation was the Protestant ethic. His colleague Joseph Schumpeter, building upon the supposed link between economic and personal growth, celebrated the entrepreneur as the innovative, heroic force behind “creative destruction”—the kind of leader who inspires joy, meaning, and purpose. The problem, Baker argues, as he combs through the legacy of German social science, is that for some, the only purpose of life is to win at any cost. “The entrepreneur became a Nietzschean conqueror,” he writes, “setting the world ablaze with his energy and virility.” This holds true even when proponents of “creative destruction” adopt a sunnier idiom in Northern California. Baker describes Steve Jobs, who encouraged “an almost cult-like esprit de corps” in his Macintosh unit, as “the most ruthless entrepreneur to emerge from the counterculture.” In Silicon Valley, charismatic leadership of the kind that aroused the Austrian economists was given a friendly, New Age twist. Baker’s genealogy helps explain why American startup culture is so deeply weird.

> **But it’s not weird**, of course, to seek work that is meaningful and satisfying. Hence the universal appeal of the entrepreneurial ethic: it offers the founder, the franchisee, the gig worker, and the influencer the same promise of freedom, and it offers those with W-2s a reason to clock in every day. Employees, no matter what their job, crave recognition, autonomy, and a personal connection to work, which is why they often contribute more than they’re paid for. Baker’s point is that celebrating workers’ “proactivity” disguises an essentially exploitative relationship. That’s especially true when the ethic becomes a management philosophy, as it did during the consulting boom of the seventies and eighties, when “value creation” and “innovation” served as important alibis for cost-cutting and deregulation. “The ultimate function of the entrepreneurial ethic,” he writes, “is to reconcile workers to precarity.” It also creates the illusion that the tech billionaire and the gig worker (who receives no benefits and cannot join a union) are aligned against the wet blanket of government regulation.

> There is nothing wrong with finding spiritual value in one’s career—provided that value doesn’t exist to be exploited by a billionaire. And of course it’s fine to love what you do. But it’s even better to treat love itself as the most important work.
#### LegoGPT
[New Lego-building AI creates models that actually stand up in real life - Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/new-ai-model-generates-buildable-lego-creations-from-text-descriptions/) 

Lovely heartwarming article about a bunch of CMU researchers training an LLM-style model for Lego bricks.

> On Thursday, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University [unveiled](https://avalovelace1.github.io/LegoGPT/) LegoGPT, an AI model that creates physically stable Lego structures from text prompts. The new system not only designs Lego models that match text descriptions (prompts) but also ensures they can be built brick by brick in the real world, either by hand or with robotic assistance.

> To build LegoGPT, the Carnegie Mellon team repurposed the technology behind large language models (LLMs), similar to the kind that run ChatGPT, for "next-brick prediction" instead of next-word prediction. To do so, the team fine-tuned [LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct), an instruction-following language model from Meta.
> 
> The team then augmented the brick-predicting model with a separate software tool that can verify physical stability using mathematical models that simulate gravity and structural forces.
> 
> To train the model, the team assembled a new dataset called "StableText2Lego," which contained over 47,000 stable Lego structures paired with descriptive captions generated by a separate AI model, OpenAI's GPT-4o. Each structure underwent physics analysis to ensure it could be built in the real world.

#### The Rise of Normanticisation
[Basic as the new punk: The rise of normanticisation | Dazed](https://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/66791/1/basic-as-the-new-punk-the-rise-of-normanticisation-2025-fashion-trend)

Good to know that the style I prefer has an actual name. Having said that this is quite a nuanced article.

> The recent embrace of ‘being basic’ isn’t simply a recession indicator, it’s part of a bigger shift away from extreme personalisation towards a more normie ideal

>  Then, last year, there was a shift: people started making fun of the [‘micro-trend final bosses’](https://www.tiktok.com/@eugbrandstrat/video/7472556002798341384?lang=en) who took personal style inspiration from the internet. Somewhat ironically, in seeking hyper-individuality through a revolving door of micro trends, [we lost true personal style along the way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXtBFiF_32k). The antithesis of this, it seems, is to look, dress and act so “basic” that it’s clear you’re not trying to differentiate yourself at all. Now, being a “normie” is becoming romanticised – or normanticised, rather.|

> Panzoni says the rise of normanticisation signals a readjustment. “It’s a response to the overconceptualization of style,” she says. “Right now, we’re seeing a widespread elevation of essentials: denim, button-ups, blazers, suits, uniforms and a broader surge of interest in minimalist fashion that has been growing during the past couple of years.” This is hardly surprising, considering that fashion [often becomes an early barometer of shifting consumer priorities](https://www.globalbankingandfinance.com/recession-fashion-the-business-of-minimalism-in-economic-downturns) during periods of economic uncertainty, but Panzoni believes something deeper is at play. She calls the quiet retreat to basics and basic dressing in fashion the “dark forest theory of fashion”. This means: “Dressing in consciously ‘basic’ ways’ (like essentials) laced with subtle cues of insider knowledge, as a strategy for safeguarding personal subjectivities from the overexposure and aesthetic extraction that’s become so common online.” In other words, the growing yearning to be “basic” can't simply be boiled down to being a “recession indicator”.

#### Learn from the skeptics
[These lessons in scepticism could make the world a better place | Psyche Ideas](https://psyche.co/ideas/these-lessons-in-scepticism-could-make-the-world-a-better-place) #skepticism #philosophy 

> We live in a paradoxical time: despite the proliferation of critical thinking courses in schools and universities, our public discourse has never been more dominated by inflexible certainties, tribal allegiances to dubious ‘facts’, and a profound aversion to questioning our own beliefs. In an age where certainty is currency, doubt has become a radical act.
> 
> Our social media ecosystems reward conviction, not contemplation. Politicians trumpet certainties rather than explore complexities. Even our educational institutions often teach critical thinking as a weapon to dismantle others’ arguments rather than a tool for examining our own. The skill we most desperately need is the very one we’ve neglected to cultivate: the ability to hold our own certainties in suspension.
> 
> What if doubt isn’t weakness but wisdom? What if the most intellectually courageous stance isn’t to plant your flag in the ground of conviction, but to embrace the productive discomfort of uncertainty? The ancient Greco-Romans, facing their own societal upheavals, developed sophisticated approaches to scepticism that might serve us better than our modern pretences to critical discourse.

The article concludes by summarizing the four sceptical lessons: Socrates teaches humility about knowledge; Protagoras reminds us of cultural perspectives and limits; Cicero encourages evidence-based provisional beliefs; and Pyrrho shows that suspending judgment leads to peace of mind.

#### The artefacts of work vs actual work

Loved the distinction between the concept of  *artifacts of work* and actual work, and how LLMs exacerbate the gap between the two. #llm #software #work #management

#### The client is not on a journey
[Ad Aged: A Journey.](https://adaged.blogspot.com/2025/05/a-journey.html) #naricissm #journey 

>  In the newsletter, Bruni quotes an Australian reader, Michael Hogan, who writes, “It feels like every damn thing I do is labeled a journey. I don’t buy a drill. I’m on a home improvement journey. I don’t see my doctor. I’m on a wellness journey. I don’t deposit money into my bank account. I’m on a wealth journey. Make it stop.” 
> 
> Bruni comments on this linguistic-tic this way:
> 
> "Maybe it’s a byproduct of the era’s narcissism, a companion to all the selfies and Instagram stories and a social media landscape in which people are always positioning themselves in the foreground, where they pose just so. It’s semantic self-aggrandizement, turning an errand into an adventure, a routine into a religion...And so humdrum activities become heroic acts."
> 
> If you use words for a living, and almost everyone does, don't use words you're used to seeing. Don't just repeat things. Don't play into the dominant complacency. Which is a obfuscator's way of saying don't be boring. 
> 
> Don't be a "story-teller." Don't promise "robust," or "agile," or "nimble." Don't look like everyone else. As Orwell told us in "Politics and the English Lanuage," "_Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which_ _you are used to seeing in print."_

#### Software Engineering and Entropy

> Now that I’ve learned to notice, my perception of software has changed in its entirety.
> 
> Every piece of software becomes a TODO list.  
> Every system becomes a scaffolding for a better one.  
> Every inconvenience becomes an indictment of inaction.

So relatable

> I’ve lost count of how many projects I have started that began with some variation of “Yeah, I could build this _but better_.”
> 
> - A static site generator because the existing ones had too many opinions.
> - A note-taking tool because I didn’t like the way others structured metadata.
> - A CLI task runner because Make is cryptic and Taskfile is YAML hell.
> - A personal wiki engine in Rust, then in Go, then in Nim, then back to Markdown.
> - A homelab dashboard because I don’t like webslop.

#### The Most Valuable Commodity in the World is Friction
[The Most Valuable Commodity in the World is Friction](https://kyla.substack.com/p/the-most-valuable-commodity-in-the) #friction #digital #economy #infrastructure

> Friction has become a defining feature across the economy, with huge consequences for everything from education to infrastructure. And it's created three distinct worlds that operate by entirely different rules:
> 
> - The **digital world** has almost no friction.
> - The **physical world** is full of it.
> - **And in certain curated space**s - like the West Village, or your AI companion -friction has been turned into something you can pay to remove.

> Tanner Greer has a beautiful breakdown of American loneliness, drawing from [Tocqueville and Wang Huning](https://scholars-stage.org/american-nightmares-wang-huning-and-alexis-de-tocqueville-dark-visions-of-the-future/). “The American,” he writes, “was an individual first, nothing second.” The result is a culture of deep, systemic isolation. Not just emotional, but economic. Americans work alone, consume alone, get rewarded alone. Even our policies, as Tocqueville feared, are structured around that loneliness.
> 
> > “When you analyze many government policies [in America] it is not difficult to see that their fundamental motivation [is in fact] the complex and persistent role played by widespread loneliness.”
> 
> Loneliness isn’t just personal. It’s institutional. It’s fiscal. It’s a bit engineered. It’s purposeful.

> This is the economic story: **friction has become a class experience**. Wealth has always helped smooth over bumps - but when the physical world is such a mess and the digital world is so easy, it’s simple to curate the digital into the physical if you have money.
> 
> …
> 
> It’s the same logic that powers Erewhon, or Soho House, or influencer-run startups. You’re not paying for the thing. You’re paying for the _removal of difficulty_. The filtered lighting. The social cachet. The sense that this world still makes sense!
