#### The Cult of Doing Business
[The Cult of Doing Business | Commonweal Magazine](https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/calvert-work-entrepreneur-ethic-baker-review-job) #business #entrepreneurship #cult

> One of the strangest features of American work culture is the constant pressure to treat one’s job as something more than a job: a calling, a means of expressing oneself, a vehicle for personal growth. This pressure comes from bosses, of course, who would rather foster intrinsic motivation than pay higher wages. But it also comes from popular psychology. As every self-help reader knows, the most successful careerists leverage their own unique personalities to achieve results and add value. They work for themselves. They love what they do. They are radiant with a higher purpose. In a word, they are “entrepreneurial.”
> 
> In his new book, [_Make Your Own Job: How the Entrepreneurial Work Ethic Exhausted America_](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674293601), historian Erik Baker calls this self-help ideology “the rot festering at the core” of our national obsession with work. A comprehensive and sharply written intellectual history, the book traces the origins of several reputedly twenty-first-century maladies to an earlier age. Gig work, as it turns out, didn’t begin with Uber but with Avon direct-sales reps. The wacky metaphysics of today’s tech billionaires have their analogues in the “mind-cures” of nineteenth-century spiritualists. And the celebration of “charismatic” executives has its origins in German social science, with disturbingly fascist undertones. Baker also demonstrates how a fetish for entrepreneurs shaped both modernization theory during the Cold War and now-discredited market-based solutions to global poverty, especially microfinance. But the “marriage of positive psychology and the entrepreneurial ethic” is the book’s primary target. It’s a rotten worldview because it “enjoins us to work more intensely than we need to,” and more importantly, it “leaves us feeling devoid of purpose when we don’t have work.”

#### LegoGPT
[New Lego-building AI creates models that actually stand up in real life - Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/new-ai-model-generates-buildable-lego-creations-from-text-descriptions/) 

Lovely heartwarming article about a bunch of CMU researchers training an LLM-style model for Lego bricks.

> On Thursday, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University [unveiled](https://avalovelace1.github.io/LegoGPT/) LegoGPT, an AI model that creates physically stable Lego structures from text prompts. The new system not only designs Lego models that match text descriptions (prompts) but also ensures they can be built brick by brick in the real world, either by hand or with robotic assistance.

> To build LegoGPT, the Carnegie Mellon team repurposed the technology behind large language models (LLMs), similar to the kind that run ChatGPT, for "next-brick prediction" instead of next-word prediction. To do so, the team fine-tuned [LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct), an instruction-following language model from Meta.
> 
> The team then augmented the brick-predicting model with a separate software tool that can verify physical stability using mathematical models that simulate gravity and structural forces.
> 
> To train the model, the team assembled a new dataset called "StableText2Lego," which contained over 47,000 stable Lego structures paired with descriptive captions generated by a separate AI model, OpenAI's GPT-4o. Each structure underwent physics analysis to ensure it could be built in the real world.

#### The Rise of Normanticisation
[Basic as the new punk: The rise of normanticisation | Dazed](https://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/66791/1/basic-as-the-new-punk-the-rise-of-normanticisation-2025-fashion-trend)

Good to know that the style I prefer has an actual name. Having said that this is quite a nuanced article.

> The recent embrace of ‘being basic’ isn’t simply a recession indicator, it’s part of a bigger shift away from extreme personalisation towards a more normie ideal

>  Then, last year, there was a shift: people started making fun of the [‘micro-trend final bosses’](https://www.tiktok.com/@eugbrandstrat/video/7472556002798341384?lang=en) who took personal style inspiration from the internet. Somewhat ironically, in seeking hyper-individuality through a revolving door of micro trends, [we lost true personal style along the way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXtBFiF_32k). The antithesis of this, it seems, is to look, dress and act so “basic” that it’s clear you’re not trying to differentiate yourself at all. Now, being a “normie” is becoming romanticised – or normanticised, rather.|

> Panzoni says the rise of normanticisation signals a readjustment. “It’s a response to the overconceptualization of style,” she says. “Right now, we’re seeing a widespread elevation of essentials: denim, button-ups, blazers, suits, uniforms and a broader surge of interest in minimalist fashion that has been growing during the past couple of years.” This is hardly surprising, considering that fashion [often becomes an early barometer of shifting consumer priorities](https://www.globalbankingandfinance.com/recession-fashion-the-business-of-minimalism-in-economic-downturns) during periods of economic uncertainty, but Panzoni believes something deeper is at play. She calls the quiet retreat to basics and basic dressing in fashion the “dark forest theory of fashion”. This means: “Dressing in consciously ‘basic’ ways’ (like essentials) laced with subtle cues of insider knowledge, as a strategy for safeguarding personal subjectivities from the overexposure and aesthetic extraction that’s become so common online.” In other words, the growing yearning to be “basic” can't simply be boiled down to being a “recession indicator”.

#### Learn from the skeptics
[These lessons in scepticism could make the world a better place | Psyche Ideas](https://psyche.co/ideas/these-lessons-in-scepticism-could-make-the-world-a-better-place) #skepticism #philosophy 

> We live in a paradoxical time: despite the proliferation of critical thinking courses in schools and universities, our public discourse has never been more dominated by inflexible certainties, tribal allegiances to dubious ‘facts’, and a profound aversion to questioning our own beliefs. In an age where certainty is currency, doubt has become a radical act.
> 
> Our social media ecosystems reward conviction, not contemplation. Politicians trumpet certainties rather than explore complexities. Even our educational institutions often teach critical thinking as a weapon to dismantle others’ arguments rather than a tool for examining our own. The skill we most desperately need is the very one we’ve neglected to cultivate: the ability to hold our own certainties in suspension.
> 
> What if doubt isn’t weakness but wisdom? What if the most intellectually courageous stance isn’t to plant your flag in the ground of conviction, but to embrace the productive discomfort of uncertainty? The ancient Greco-Romans, facing their own societal upheavals, developed sophisticated approaches to scepticism that might serve us better than our modern pretences to critical discourse.

The article concludes by summarizing the four sceptical lessons: Socrates teaches humility about knowledge; Protagoras reminds us of cultural perspectives and limits; Cicero encourages evidence-based provisional beliefs; and Pyrrho shows that suspending judgment leads to peace of mind.

#### The artefacts of work vs actual work

Loved the distinction between the concept of  *artifacts of work* and actual work, and how LLMs exacerbate the gap between the two. #llm #software #work #management
