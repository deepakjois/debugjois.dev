#### yt-dlp hacks
Found here: [q and qv zsh functions for asking questions of websites and YouTube videos with LLM](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/19/q-and-qv-zsh-functions/#atom-everything) #ytdlp #youtube #hacks #llm 

```
yt-dlp -q --skip-download --convert-subs srt --write-sub --sub-langs "en" --write-auto-sub --print "requested_subtitles.en.url" "$url"
```

In plain English, this command will:

1. Find a video at the specified URL

3. Convert them to SRT format
4. Print out the URL where these subtitles can be found
5. Do all this quietly (minimal output) and without downloading the actual video

And despite ongoing demands for better research, I think it is fair to say that if there _were_ significant and reliable differences in therapeutic approaches, researchers would have found them by now. They haven’t.[8](https://thelivingfossils.substack.com/p/the-placebo-effect-in-therapy-part#footnote-8-153381769)

> Research has, however, established therapy as a moderately effective solution to a wide range of mental problems. Perhaps a better question to ask at this point, then, is why does therapy work at all? If all or most techniques deliver some benefit, then clearly something they _share_ is responsible—for example, a safe environment, a collaborative relationship with a supposed expert, the structure of weekly or biweekly sessions, and, of course, the expectation that therapy will work. I.e., placebo.

They also point out that despite the moderately net-positive effects of therapy, the drawbacks are w
