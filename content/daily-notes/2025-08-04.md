#### Are we in an AI Bubble
[The AI bubble is so big it's propping up the US economy (for now)](https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/the-ai-bubble-is-so-big-its-propping) #ai #bubble #economy 

> I’ll just repeat that. Over the last six months, capital expenditures on AI—counting just information processing equipment and software, by the way—added more to the growth of the US economy than all consumer spending combined. You can just pull any of those quotes out—spending on IT for AI is so big it might be making up for economic losses from the tariffs, serving as a _private sector stimulus program_.

> To me, this is just screaming bubble. I’m sure I’m not alone. In fact I _know_ I’m not alone. I’m thinking especially of [Ed Zitron’s impassioned and](https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-haters-gui/) _[](https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-haters-gui/)_[thorough guide to the AI bubble](https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-haters-gui/); a rundown of how much money is being poured into and spent on AI vs how much money these products are making, and surprise, the situation as it stands is not sustainable. Worrying signs abound, and not least that so far, the companies benefitting most from AI are those selling the tools to simply build _more_ of it (Nvidia, Microsoft), or who have monopolies through which they can force AI tools onto users en masse with limited repercussions (Google, Meta). Consumers routinely evince negative sentiment towards AI and AI products in polls, outweighing enthusiasm. And meanwhile, what I’d say is the only truly runaway, organically popular AI product category, chatbots, largely remain big money losers due to the resources they take to run.

> As such, these massive valuations feel fishy. I asked Ed for his thoughts on Microsoft’s $4 trillion earnings report. He said:
> 
> Microsoft broke out Azure revenue for the first time in history, yet has not updated their annualized revenue for AI since January 29 2025. If things were going so well with AI, why are they not providing these numbers? It's because things aren't going well at all, and they're trying to play funny games with numbers to confuse and excite investors.
> 
> Also, $10bn+ of that Azure revenue is OpenAI's compute costs, paid at-cost, meaning no profit (and maybe even loss!) for Microsoft.

> Look, I’m no prophet, clearly. I’ve predicted that we were probably witnessing the peak of the AI boom *nearly a year ago*, and while I think I was right with regard to genuine consumer and pop cultural interest, obviously the investment and expansion has kept right on flowing. It’s to the point that we’re well past dot com boom levels of investment, and, as Kedrosky points out, approaching railroad-levels of investment, last seen in the days of the robber barons.
